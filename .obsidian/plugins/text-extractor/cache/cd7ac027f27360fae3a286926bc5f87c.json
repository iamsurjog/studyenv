To describe the trade-offs between conflicting objectives in large scale system design. 3. To develop the knowledge for application of the various design issues and services. Course Outcomes On completion of this course, student should be able to: 1. Interpret the evolution of OS functionality, structures, layers and apply various types of system calls of various process states. 2. Design scheduling algorithms to compute and compare various scheduling criteria. 3. Apply and analyze communication between inter process and synchronization techniques. 4.Implement page replacement algorithms, memory management problems and segmentation. 5.Differentiate the file systems for applying different allocation, access technique, representing virtualization and providing protection and security to OS.
