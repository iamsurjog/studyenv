FLSM streamlines packet routing within the subnets of a proprietary network. •A subnet can be a geographically defined local area network (LAN). Alternatively, it may define security boundaries, departmental boundaries, multicast zones or hardware security parameters. One benefit is to create locally significant subnet identification addresses •Subnetting means dividing a network into multiple smaller subnetworks by using a subnetting mask. In FLSM, the number of IP addresses is the same in each subnet. Another way of saying this is that the same number of IP addresses are allocated to each subnet. Therefore, the subnet mask used will be the same for all the subnets. What is a Variable-length subnet mask (VLSM)? •Varrying based on required hosts Problem 1: Problem 2 For 500th subnet Problem 3 •Consider a block of address with starting address 112.78.0.0/16. Find the first and last addresses for each group, if the number and size of the subnets required by them are as given in the input. •Group-1: •256 subnets, each needs 128 addresses •Group-2: •1024 subnets, each requiring 4 addresses •Group-3: •128 subnets, each consisting of 16 addresses","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
