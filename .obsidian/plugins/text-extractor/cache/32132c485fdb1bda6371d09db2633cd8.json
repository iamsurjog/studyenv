Navathei Slide 3- 4 Overview of Database Design Process  Two main activities:  Database design  Applications design  Focus in this chapter on database design  To design the conceptual schema for a database application  Applications design focuses on the programs and interfaces that access the database  Generally considered part of software engineering Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 5 Overview of Database Design Process Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 6 Example COMPANY Database  We need to create a database schema design based on the following (simplified) requirements of the COMPANY Database:  The company is organized into DEPARTMENTs. Each department has a name, number and an employee who manages the department. We keep track of the start date of the department manager. A department may have several locations.  Each department controls a number of PROJECTs. Each project has a unique name, unique number and is located at a single location. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 7 Example COMPANY Database (Contd.)  We store each EMPLOYEE’s social security number, address, salary, sex, and birthdate.  Each employee works for one department but may work on several projects.  We keep track of the number of hours per week that an employee currently works on each project.  We also keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee.  Each employee may have a number of DEPENDENTs.  For each dependent, we keep track of their name, sex, birthdate, and relationship to the employee. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 8 ER Model Concepts  Entities and Attributes  Entities are specific objects or things in the mini-world that are represented in the database.  For example the EMPLOYEE John Smith, the Research DEPARTMENT, the ProductX PROJECT  Attributes are properties used to describe an entity.  For example an EMPLOYEE entity may have the attributes Name, SSN, Address, Sex, BirthDate  A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes.  For example a specific employee entity may have Name='John Smith', SSN='123456789', Address ='731, Fondren, Houston, TX', Sex='M', BirthDate='09-JAN-55‘  Each attribute has a value set (or data type) associated with it – e.g. integer, string, subrange, enumerated type, … Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 9 Types of Attributes (1)  Simple  Each entity has a single atomic value for the attribute. For example, SSN or Sex.  Composite  The attribute may be composed of several components. For example:  Address(Apt#, House#, Street, City, State, ZipCode, Country), or  Name(FirstName, MiddleName, LastName).  Composition may form a hierarchy where some components are themselves composite.  Multi-valued  An entity may have multiple values for that attribute. For example, Color of a CAR or PreviousDegrees of a STUDENT.  Denoted as {Color} or {PreviousDegrees}. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 10 Types of Attributes (2)  In general, composite and multi-valued attributes may be nested arbitrarily to any number of levels, although this is rare.  For example, PreviousDegrees of a STUDENT is a composite multi-valued attribute denoted by {PreviousDegrees (College, Year, Degree, Field)}  Multiple PreviousDegrees values can exist  Each has four subcomponent attributes:  College, Year, Degree, Field Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 11 Example of a composite attribute Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 12 Entity Types and Key Attributes (1)  Entities with the same basic attributes are grouped or typed into an entity type.  For example, the entity type EMPLOYEE and PROJECT.  An attribute of an entity type for which each entity must have a unique value is called a key attribute of the entity type.  For example, SSN of EMPLOYEE. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 13 Entity Types and Key Attributes (2)  A key attribute may be composite.  VehicleTagNumber is a key of the CAR entity type with components (Number, State).  An entity type may have more than one key.  The CAR entity type may have two keys:  VehicleIdentificationNumber (popularly called VIN)  VehicleTagNumber (Number, State), aka license plate number.  Each key is underlined Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 14 Displaying an Entity type  In ER diagrams, an entity type is displayed in a rectangular box  Attributes are displayed in ovals  Each attribute is connected to its entity type  Components of a composite attribute are connected to the oval representing the composite attribute  Each key attribute is underlined  Multivalued attributes displayed in double ovals  See CAR example on next slide Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 15 Entity Type CAR with two keys and a corresponding Entity Set Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 16 Entity Set  Each entity type will have a collection of entities stored in the database  Called the entity set  Previous slide shows three CAR entity instances in the entity set for CAR  Same name (CAR) used to refer to both the entity type and the entity set  Entity set is the current state of the entities of that type that are stored in the database Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 17 Initial Design of Entity Types for the COMPANY Database Schema  Based on the requirements, we can identify four initial entity types in the COMPANY database:  DEPARTMENT  PROJECT  EMPLOYEE  DEPENDENT  Their initial design is shown on the following slide  The initial attributes shown are derived from the requirements description Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 18 Initial Design of Entity Types: EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, DEPENDENT Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 19 Refining the initial design by introducing relationships  The initial design is typically not complete  Some aspects in the requirements will be represented as relationships  ER model has three main concepts:  Entities (and their entity types and entity sets)  Attributes (simple, composite, multivalued)  Relationships (and their relationship types and relationship sets)  We introduce relationship concepts next Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 20 Relationships and Relationship Types (1)  A relationship relates two or more distinct entities with a specific meaning.  For example, EMPLOYEE John Smith works on the ProductX PROJECT, or EMPLOYEE Franklin Wong manages the Research DEPARTMENT.  Relationships of the same type are grouped or typed into a relationship type.  For example, the WORKS_ON relationship type in which EMPLOYEEs and PROJECTs participate, or the MANAGES relationship type in which EMPLOYEEs and DEPARTMENTs participate.  The degree of a relationship type is the number of participating entity types.  Both MANAGES and WORKS_ON are binary relationships. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 21 Relationship instances of the WORKS_FOR N:1 relationship between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 22 Relationship instances of the M:N WORKS_ON relationship between EMPLOYEE and PROJECT Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 23 Relationship type vs. relationship set (1)  Relationship Type:  Is the schema description of a relationship  Identifies the relationship name and the participating entity types  Also identifies certain relationship constraints  Relationship Set:  The current set of relationship instances represented in the database  The current state of a relationship type Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 24 Relationship type vs. relationship set (2)  Previous figures displayed the relationship sets  Each instance in the set relates individual participating entities – one from each participating entity type  In ER diagrams, we represent the relationship type as follows:  Diamond-shaped box is used to display a relationship type  Connected to the participating entity types via straight lines Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 25 Refining the COMPANY database schema by introducing relationships  By examining the requirements, six relationship types are identified  All are binary relationships( degree 2)  Listed below with their participating entity types:  WORKS_FOR (between EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT)  MANAGES (also between EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT)  CONTROLS (between DEPARTMENT, PROJECT)  WORKS_ON (between EMPLOYEE, PROJECT)  SUPERVISION (between EMPLOYEE (as subordinate), EMPLOYEE (as supervisor))  DEPENDENTS_OF (between EMPLOYEE, DEPENDENT) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 26 ER DIAGRAM – Relationship Types are: WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, WORKS_ON, CONTROLS, SUPERVISION, DEPENDENTS_OF Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 27 Discussion on Relationship Types  In the refined design, some attributes from the initial entity types are refined into relationships:  Manager of DEPARTMENT -> MANAGES  Works_on of EMPLOYEE -> WORKS_ON  Department of EMPLOYEE -> WORKS_FOR  etc  In general, more than one relationship type can exist between the same participating entity types  MANAGES and WORKS_FOR are distinct relationship types between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT  Different meanings and different relationship instances. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 28 Recursive Relationship Type  An relationship type whose with the same participating entity type in distinct roles  Example: the SUPERVISION relationship  EMPLOYEE participates twice in two distinct roles:  supervisor (or boss) role  supervisee (or subordinate) role  Each relationship instance relates two distinct EMPLOYEE entities:  One employee in supervisor role  One employee in supervisee role Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 29 Weak Entity Types  An entity that does not have a key attribute  A weak entity must participate in an identifying relationship type with an owner or identifying entity type  Entities are identified by the combination of:  A partial key of the weak entity type  The particular entity they are related to in the identifying entity type  Example:  A DEPENDENT entity is identified by the dependent’s first name, and the specific EMPLOYEE with whom the dependent is related  Name of DEPENDENT is the partial key  DEPENDENT is a weak entity type  EMPLOYEE is its identifying entity type via the identifying relationship type DEPENDENT_OF Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 30 Constraints on Relationships  Constraints on Relationship Types  (Also known as ratio constraints)  Cardinality Ratio (specifies maximum participation)  One-to-one (1:1)  One-to-many (1:N) or Many-to-one (N:1)  Many-to-many (M:N)  Existence Dependency Constraint (specifies minimum participation) (also called participation constraint)  zero (optional participation, not existence-dependent)  one or more (mandatory participation, existence-dependent) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 31 Many-to-one (N:1) Relationship Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 32 Many-to-many (M:N) Relationship Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 33 Displaying a recursive relationship  In a recursive relationship type.  Both participations are same entity type in different roles.  For example, SUPERVISION relationships between EMPLOYEE (in role of supervisor or boss) and (another) EMPLOYEE (in role of subordinate or worker).  In following figure, first role participation labeled with 1 and second role participation labeled with 2.  In ER diagram, need to display role names to distinguish participations. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 34 A Recursive Relationship Supervision` Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 35 Recursive Relationship Type is: SUPERVISION (participation role names are shown) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 36 Attributes of Relationship types  A relationship type can have attributes:  For example, HoursPerWeek of WORKS_ON  Its value for each relationship instance describes the number of hours per week that an EMPLOYEE works on a PROJECT.  A value of HoursPerWeek depends on a particular (employee, project) combination  Most relationship attributes are used with M:N relationships  In 1:N relationships, they can be transferred to the entity type on the N-side of the relationship Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 37 Example Attribute of a Relationship Type: Hours of WORKS_ON Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 38 Notation for Constraints on Relationships  Cardinality ratio (of a binary relationship): 1:1, 1:N, N:1, or M:N  Shown by placing appropriate numbers on the relationship edges.  Participation constraint (on each participating entity type): total (called existence dependency) or partial.  Total shown by double line, partial by single line.  NOTE: These are easy to specify for Binary Relationship Types. Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 39 Alternative (min, max) notation for relationship structural constraints:  Specified on each participation of an entity type E in a relationship type R  Specifies that each entity e in E participates in at least min and at most max relationship instances in R  Default(no constraint): min=0, max=n (signifying no limit)  Must have minmax, min0, max 1  Derived from the knowledge of mini-world constraints  Examples:  A department has exactly one manager and an employee can manage at most one department.  Specify (0,1) for participation of EMPLOYEE in MANAGES  Specify (1,1) for participation of DEPARTMENT in MANAGES  An employee can work for exactly one department but a department can have any number of employees.  Specify (1,1) for participation of EMPLOYEE in WORKS_FOR  Specify (0,n) for participation of DEPARTMENT in WORKS_FOR Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 40 The (min,max) notation for relationship constraints Read the min,max numbers next to the entity type and looking away from the entity type Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 41 COMPANY ER Schema Diagram using (min, max) notation Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 42 Alternative diagrammatic notation  ER diagrams is one popular example for displaying database schemas  Many other notations exist in the literature and in various database design and modeling tools  Appendix A illustrates some of the alternative notations that have been used  UML class diagrams is representative of another way of displaying ER concepts that is used in several commercial design tools Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 43 Summary of notation for ER diagrams Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 44 UML class diagrams  Represent classes (similar to entity types) as large rounded boxes with three sections:  Top section includes entity type (class) name  Second section includes attributes  Third section includes class operations (operations are not in basic ER model)  Relationships (called associations) represented as lines connecting the classes  Other UML terminology also differs from ER terminology  Used in database design and object-oriented software design  UML has many other types of diagrams for software design (see Chapter 12) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 45 UML class diagram for COMPANY database schema Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 46 Other alternative diagrammatic notations Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 47 Relationships of Higher Degree  Relationship types of degree 2 are called binary  Relationship types of degree 3 are called ternary and of degree n are called n-ary  In general, an n-ary relationship is not equivalent to n binary relationships  Constraints are harder to specify for higher- degree relationships (n > 2) than for binary relationships Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 48 Discussion of n-ary relationships (n > 2)  In general, 3 binary relationships can represent different information than a single ternary relationship (see Figure 3.17a and b on next slide)  If needed, the binary and n-ary relationships can all be included in the schema design (see Figure 3.17a and b, where all relationships convey different meanings)  In some cases, a ternary relationship can be represented as a weak entity if the data model allows a weak entity type to have multiple identifying relationships (and hence multiple owner entity types) (see Figure 3.17c) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 49 Example of a ternary relationship Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 50 Discussion of n-ary relationships (n > 2)  If a particular binary relationship can be derived from a higher-degree relationship at all times, then it is redundant  For example, the TAUGHT_DURING binary relationship in Figure 3.18 (see next slide) can be derived from the ternary relationship OFFERS (based on the meaning of the relationships) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 51 Another example of a ternary relationship Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 52 Displaying constraints on higher-degree relationships  The (min, max) constraints can be displayed on the edges – however, they do not fully describe the constraints  Displaying a 1, M, or N indicates additional constraints  An M or N indicates no constraint  A 1 indicates that an entity can participate in at most one relationship instance that has a particular combination of the other participating entities  In general, both (min, max) and 1, M, or N are needed to describe fully the constraints Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B. Navathei Slide 3- 53 Data Modeling Tools  A number of popular tools that cover conceptual modeling and mapping into relational schema design.  Examples: ERWin, S- Designer (Enterprise Application Suite), ER- Studio, etc.  POSITIVES:  Serves as documentation of application requirements, easy user interface - mostly graphics editor support  NEGATIVES:  Most tools lack a proper distinct notation for relationships with relationship attributes  Mostly represent a relational design in a diagrammatic form rather than a conceptual ER-based design (See Chapter 12 for details) Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasr and Shamkant B.
