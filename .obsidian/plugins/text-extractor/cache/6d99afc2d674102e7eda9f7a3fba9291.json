Relation already exists in 2NF. 2. No transitive dependency exists for non-prime attributes.   Transitive Dependency   A B is called a transitive dependency if and only if-→ 1. A is not a super key. 2. B is a non-prime attribute. If any one condition fails, then it is not a transitive dependency.   NOTE-    Transitive dependency must not exist for non-prime attributes.  However, transitive dependency can exist for prime attributes.   OR   A relation is called in Third Normal Form (3NF) if and only if- Any one condition holds for each non-trivial functional dependency A B→ 1. A is a super key 2. B is a prime attribute   Example-   Consider a relation- R ( A , B , C , D , E ) with functional dependencies- A BC→ CD  E→ B D→ E A→   The possible candidate keys for this relation are- A , E , CD ,   From here,  Prime attributes = { A , B , C , D , E }  There are no non-prime attributes   Now,  It is clear that there are no non-prime attributes in the relation.  In other words, all the attributes of relation are prime attributes.  Thus, all the attributes on RHS of each functional dependency are prime attributes.   Thus, we conclude that the given relation is in 3NF.   Boyce-Codd Normal Form-   A given relation is called in BCNF if and only if- 1. Relation already exists in 3NF. 2. For each non-trivial functional dependency A B, A is a super → key of the relation.   Example-   Consider a relation- R ( A , B , C ) with the functional dependencies- A B→ B C→ C A→   The possible candidate keys for this relation are- A , B , C   Now, we can observe that RHS of each given functional dependency is a candidate key. Thus, we conclude that the given relation is in BCNF.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
