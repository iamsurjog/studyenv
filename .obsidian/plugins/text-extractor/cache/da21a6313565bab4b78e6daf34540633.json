NoteNote:: 5 The IP addresses are unique and universal. NoteNote:: 6 Figure 19.9 Dotted-decimal notation 7 The binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems are reviewed in Appendix B. NoteNote:: 8 Example 1Example 1 Change the following IP addresses from binary notation to dotted- decimal notation. a. 10000001 00001011 00001011 11101111 b. 11111001 10011011 11111011 00001111 SolutionSolution We replace each group of 8 bits with its equivalent decimal number (see Appendix B) and add dots for separation: a. 129.11.11.239 b. 249.155.251.15 9 Example 2Example 2 Change the following IP addresses from dotted-decimal notation to binary notation. a. 111.56.45.78 b. 75.45.34.78 SolutionSolution We replace each decimal number with its binary equivalent (see Appendix B): a. 01101111 00111000 00101101 01001110 b. 01001011 00101101 00100010 01001110 10 In classful addressing, the address space is divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. NoteNote:: 11 Figure 19.10 Finding the class in binary and Decimal notation 12 Figure 19.11 Finding the address class 14 Example 3Example 3 Find the class of each address: a. 000000001 00001011 00001011 11101111 b. 111111110011 10011011 11111011 00001111 SolutionSolution See the procedure in Figure 19.11. a. The first bit is 0; this is a class A address. b. The first 4 bits are 1s; this is a class E address. 15 Example 4Example 4 Find the class of each address: a. 227.12.14.87 b. 252.5.15.111 c. 134.11.78.56 SolutionSolution a. The first byte is 227 (between 224 and 239); the class is D. b. The first byte is 252 (between 240 and 255); the class is E. c. The first byte is 134 (between 128 and 191); the class is B. 16 Figure 19.13 Netid and hostid 17 Table 19.1 Default masksTable 19.1 Default masks Class In Bin a r y In Do t t ed - Decim a l Us in g Sla s h A 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 255.0.0.0 /8 B 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000 255.255.0.0 /16 C 11111111 111111111 11111111 00000000 255.255.255.0 /24 18 =2^16-2 2^24-2 =2^8-2 =2^7-2 =2^14-2 =2^21-2 Figure 19.14 Blocks in class A 19 Millions of class A addresses are wasted. NoteNote:: 20 Figure 19.15 Blocks in class B 21 Many class B addresses are wasted. NoteNote:: 22 The number of addresses in class C is smaller than the needs of most organizations. NoteNote:: 23 Figure 19.16 Blocks in class C 24 Figure 19.17 Network address 25 In classful addressing, the network address is the one that is assigned to the organization. NoteNote:: 26 Example 5Example 5 Given the address 23.56.7.91, find the network address. SolutionSolution The class is A. Only the first byte defines the netid. We can find the network address by replacing the hostid bytes (56.7.91) with 0s. Therefore, the network address is 23.0.0.0. 27 Example 6Example 6 Given the address 132.6.17.85, find the network address. SolutionSolution The class is B. The first 2 bytes defines the netid. We can find the network address by replacing the hostid bytes (17.85) with 0s. Therefore, the network address is 132.6.0.0. 28 Example 7Example 7 Given the network address 17.0.0.0, find the class. SolutionSolution The class is A because the netid is only 1 byte. 29 A network address is different from a netid. A network address has both netid and hostid, with 0s for the hostid. NoteNote:: 32 Classless addressing Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) • a method of IP address allocation and IP routing •IP addresses can be allocated and routed based on their network prefix rather than their class, •which was the traditional way of IP address allocation. •represented using a slash notation, which specifies the number of bits in the network prefix. •For example, an IP address of 192.168.1.0 with a prefix length of 24 would be represented as 192.168.1.0/24. Figure 19.18 Sample internet 41 IP addresses are designed with two levels of hierarchy. NoteNote:: 42 Figure 19.19 A network with two levels of hierarchy 43 Figure 19.20 A network with three levels of hierarchy (subnetted) 44 Figure 19.21 Addresses in a network with and without subnetting 45 Figure 19.22 Hierarchy concept in a telephone number 46 The network address can be found by applying the default mask to any address in the block (including itself). It retains the netid of the block and sets the hostid to 0s. NoteNote:: 47 Example 8Example 8 A router outside the organization receives a packet with destination address 190.240.7.91. Show how it finds the network address to route the packet. SolutionSolution The router follows three steps: 1. The router looks at the first byte of the address to find the class. It is class B. 2. The default mask for class B is 255.255.0.0. The router ANDs this mask with the address to get 190.240.0.0. 3. The router looks in its routing table to find out how to route the packet to this destination. Later, we will see what happens if this destination does not exist. 48 Figure 19.23 Subnet mask 49 Example 9Example 9 A router inside the organization receives the same packet with destination address 190.240.33.91. Show how it finds the subnetwork address to route the packet. SolutionSolution The router follows three steps: 1. The router must know the mask. We assume it is /19, as shown in Figure 19.23. 2. The router applies the mask to the address, 190.240.33.91. The subnet address is 190.240.32.0. 3. The router looks in its routing table to find how to route the packet to this destination. Later, we will see what happens if this destination does not exist. 50 Figure 19.24 DHCP transition diagram 51 Table 19.2 Default masksTable 19.2 Default masks Ra n ge To t a l 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 2 24 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 2 20 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 2 16 52 Figure 19.25 NAT 53 Figure 19.26 Address translation 54 Figure 19.27 Translation 55 Table 19.3 Five-column translation tableTable 19.3 Five-column translation table Private Address Private Port Ex ternal Address Ex ternal Port Tr ansport Protocol 172.18.3.1 1400 25.8.3.2 80 TCP 172.18.3.2 1401 25.8.3.2 80 TCP ... ... ... ... ... 56 19.3 Routing19.3 Routing Routing Techniques Static Versus Dynamic Routing Routing Table for Classful Addressing Routing Table for Classless Addressing 57 Figure 19.28 Next-hop routing 58 Figure 19.29 Network-specific routing 59 Figure 19.30 Host-specific routing 60 Figure 19.31 Default routing 61 Figure 19.32 Classful addressing routing table 62 Routing Algorithms 1.Distance Vector Routing 2.Link State Routing 66 The Concept of Distance Vector Routing 67 Distance Vector Routing Table 68 Routing Table Distribution 69 Updating Routing Table for Router A 70 Final Routing Tables 7172 Figure 21-24 Concept of Link State Routing 73 Figure 21-25 Cost in Link State Routing 74 Figure 21-26 Link State Packet 75 Figure 21-27 Flooding of A’s LSP 76 Figure 21-28 Link State Database 77","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
