Most suitable Agent Here it is given dynamic factors like traffic, road conditions, toll plazas and weather conditions, so most suitable model is Model based agent. Whereas for learning-based agent it can learn from past experiences, for continuous improvement, which is not that in this case as the given scenario is dynamic in nature. 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 31 Sample Questions – Q2 ▪ Q2 Ans: 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 32 Sample Questions – Q2 ▪ Q2 Ans: 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 33 Sample Questions – Q2 ▪ Q2 Ans: 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 34 Learning agents shine in dynamic, data-rich environments with changing conditions and feedback loops. Other agent types are more efficient and reliable when: •Goals are fixed and known, •The environment is predictable, •Or learning is costly, risky, or unnecessary. Sample Questions – Q2 ▪ Q2 Ans: 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 35 In many real-world systems, these agents are combined. A typical intelligent delivery system might: •Use a model-based agent to simulate traffic •Apply goal-based logic to ensure delivery time constraints •Use a utility function to weigh cost vs. time •And incorporate learning to refine decisions over time. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of each type. Thank you 7/19/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306L) 36 Questions ?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
