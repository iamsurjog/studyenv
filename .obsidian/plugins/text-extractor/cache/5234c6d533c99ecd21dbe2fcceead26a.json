When one thread alters a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.  A thread is also called a lightweight process. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the overhead thread is equivalent to a classical process. 4.3 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition  Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process.  Each thread represents a separate flow of control. Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers and web server.  They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors. The following figure shows the working of a single-threaded and a multithreaded process. 4.4 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Single and Multithreaded Processes 4.5 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Benefits  Responsiveness  Resource Sharing  Economy  Scalability 4.6 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Multicore Programming  Multicore systems putting pressure on programmers, challenges include:  Dividing activities  Balance  Data splitting  Data dependency  Testing and debugging 4.7 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Multithreaded Server Architecture 4.8 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Concurrent Execution on a Single-core System 4.9 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Parallel Execution on a Multicore System 4.10 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition User Threads  Thread management done by user-level threads library  All of the thread management is done by the application and the kernel is not aware of the existence of threads.  Three primary thread libraries:  POSIX Pthreads  Win32 threads  Java threads  Advantages of user level threads:  There are a number of advantages to the use of ULTs instead of KLTs  Thread switching does not require kernel mode privileges  Scheduling can be application specific  ULTs can run on any OS.  Disadvantages of user level threads:  When a ULT executes a blocking system call, not only is that thread blocked, but also all of the threads within the process are blocked.  A Multithreaded application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing. A kernel assigns one process to only one processor at a time. 4.11 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Kernel Threads  Supported by the Kernel  There is no thread management code in the application level, simply an application programming interface (API) to the kernel thread facility.  The kernel maintains context information for the process as a whole and for individual threads within the process.  Examples  Windows XP/2000  Solaris  Linux  Tru64 UNIX  Mac OS X  Advantages of Kernel level threads:  The kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processors.  If one thread in a process is blocked, the kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.  Disadvantages of kernel level threads:  The transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires a mode switch to the kernel. 4.12 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Multithreading Models  Many-to-One  One-to-One  Many-to-Many 4.13 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Many-to-One  Many user-level threads mapped to single kernel thread  Examples:  Solaris Green Threads  GNU Portable Threads 4.14 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Many-to-One Model 4.15 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition One-to-One  Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread  Examples  Windows NT/XP/2000  Linux  Solaris 9 and later 4.16 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition One-to-one Model 4.17 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Many-to-Many Model  Allows many user level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads  Allows the operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads  Solaris prior to version 9  Windows NT/2000 with the ThreadFiber package 4.18 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Many-to-Many Model 4.19 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Two-level Model  Similar to M:M, except that it allows a user thread to be bound to kernel thread  Examples  IRIX  HP-UX  Tru64 UNIX  Solaris 8 and earlier 4.20 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Two-level Model 4.21 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Thread Libraries  Thread library provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads  Two primary ways of implementing  Library entirely in user space  Kernel-level library supported by the OS 4.22 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Comparison Between Process and Threads S.N. Process Thread 1 Process is heavy weight or resource intensive. Thread is light weight, taking lesser resources than a process. 2 Process switching needs interaction with operating system. Thread switching does not need to interact with operating system. 3 In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has its own memory and file resources. All threads can share same set of open files, child processes. 4 If one process is blocked, then no other process can execute until the first process is unblocked. While one thread is blocked and waiting, a second thread in the same task can run. 5 Multiple processes without using threads use more resources. Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources. 6 In multiple processes each process operates independently of the others. One thread can read, write or change another thread's data. 4.23 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Why Pthreads  The primary motivation for using Pthreads is to realize potential program performance gains.  When compared to the cost of creating and managing a process, a thread can be created with much less operating system overhead. Managing threads requires fewer system resources than managing processes.  All threads within a process share the same address space. Inter-thread communication is more efficient and in many cases, easier to use than inter-process communication.  Threaded applications offer potential performance gains and practical advantages over non- threaded applications in several other ways:  Overlapping CPU work with I/O: For example, a program may have sections where it is performing a long I/O operation. While one thread is waiting for an I/O system call to complete, other threads can perform CPU intensive work.  Priority/real-time scheduling: tasks that are more important can be scheduled to supersede or interrupt lower priority tasks.  Multi-threaded applications will work on a uni-processor system; yet naturally take advantage of a multiprocessor system, without recompiling. 4.24 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Java Threads  Java threads are managed by the JVM  Typically implemented using the threads model provided by underlying OS  Java threads may be created by:  Extending Thread class  Implementing the Runnable interface 4.25 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Threading Issues  Semantics of fork() and exec() system calls  Thread cancellation of target thread  Asynchronous or deferred  Signal handling  Synchronous and asynchronous 4.26 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Threading Issues (Cont.)  Thread pools  Thread-specific data  Create Facility needed for data private to thread  Scheduler activations 4.27 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Semantics of fork() and exec()  Does fork() duplicate only the calling thread or all threads?  exec() - replace the running process including all threads 4.28 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Thread Cancellation  Terminating a thread before it has finished  Two general approaches:  Asynchronous cancellation terminates the target thread immediately.  Deferred cancellation allows the target thread to periodically check if it should be cancelled. 4.29 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Signal Handling  Signals are used in UNIX systems to notify a process that a particular event has occurred.  A signal handler is used to process signals 1. Signal is generated by particular event 2. Signal is delivered to a process 3. Signal is handled  Options:  Deliver the signal to the thread to which the signal applies  Deliver the signal to every thread in the process  Deliver the signal to certain threads in the process  Assign a specific thread to receive all signals for the process 4.30 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Thread Pools  Create a number of threads in a pool where they await work  Advantages:  Usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than create a new thread  Allows the number of threads in the application(s) to be bound to the size of the pool 4.31 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Thread Specific Data  Allows each thread to have its own copy of data  Useful when you do not have control over the thread creation process (i.e., when using a thread pool) 4.32 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Scheduler Activations  Both M:M and Two-level models require communication to maintain the appropriate number of kernel threads allocated to the application  Scheduler activations provide upcalls - a communication mechanism from the kernel to the thread library  This communication allows an application to maintain the correct number kernel threads 4.33 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Lightweight Processes 4.34 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Operating System Examples  Windows XP Threads  Linux Thread 4.35 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Linux Threads  Linux refers to them as tasks rather than threads  Thread creation is done through clone() system call  clone() allows a child task to share the address space of the parent task (process)  struct task_struct points to process data structures (shared or unique) 4.36 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2009Operating System Concepts – 8th Edition Linux Threads  fork() and clone() system calls  Doesn’t distinguish between process and thread  Uses term task rather than thread  clone() takes options to determine sharing on process create  struct task_struct points to process data structures (shared or unique)","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
