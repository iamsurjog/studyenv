(5 Marks) Design an appropriate OS structure as per the functionalities listed above with proper justification. (5 Marks) Ram's objective is to read the contents from the file \"Temp.txt\" and list out the number of vowels, consonants and words from the parent process. Write a C program using comprehensive sequence of system calls would be necessary to accomplish this task proficiently. (5 Marks) Delineate the distinct system calls essential for this operation and elucidate their individual functionalities in detail. (5 Marks) Also calculate the execution time of each thread. (2 Marks) As a programmer, build the pseudo code to construct two threads, one for creating the list of even numbers and the other for generating the list of add numbers (for example, call them Thread1, Thread2). Explain in detail the required thread predefined functions that were used to initiate the thread and all of its additional predefined functions using POSIX API. (8 Marks) Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times Marks 10 10 10 10 indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use non pre-emptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made. Process PI P2 P3 P4 P5 Arrival Time if, 4 1 3 Burst Time 3 1 6 a) Compute the average waiting time & turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm? (Gantt Chart-2 marks, Average Waiting time-1 Mark and Average Turnaround time-1 Mark) b) Whether the pre-emptive SJF will give a better result as compared to the previous SJF algorithm? Compute and compare the average waiting time and turnaround time (in both cases). (Gant Chart-2 marks, Average waiting time-1 Mark and Average Turnaround time-1 Mark)Suggest a new scheme to improve the CPU utilization further when compared with the mentioned two algorithms in a) and b). (2 Marks) Assume four students [S1, S2, S3, S4] would like to take an OS book from the library. Unfortunately, only one copy is available for reference. Assuming S1 will read the book for 10m, S2 for 12m, S3 for 2m, and S4 for 6m. AIl the students arrive the library at the same time. Analyse the scenario with appropriate short term scheduler and determine the (a) Completion Time (b) Average Turn Around Time (c) Average Waiting Time of the students in library, a) The students are allowed to read the book based on the priority 5, 3, 2, 4, 1 respectively. (Gantt Chart-2 marks, Completion time-1 Mark, Average Waiting time-1 Mark and Average Turnaround time-1 Mark) b) The students are allowed to read the book one after the other for 3m in each of their turn.
