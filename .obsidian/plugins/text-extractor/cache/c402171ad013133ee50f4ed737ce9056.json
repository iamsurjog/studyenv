Answer ALL Questions (10 X 10 = 100 Marks) Explain th e difference between a database schema and a database state [4] with a suitable example. Differentiate between logical data independence and physical data [6] ind~pendence, . providing examples to illustrate their concepts. Finally, discuss the challenges and benefits associated with achieving these levels of data independence. 2,a) Design an EER diagram to capture the requirements of an e-commerce platform that sells products online. The platform should allow users to browse products, add them to their shopping carts, checkout, and track their orders. Every product has a unique ID, name, description, price, quantity in stock, and category. Categories represent different product groups (e.g., electronics, clothing, books). Products can be categorized into different types (e.g., books, electronics, and clothing). Every customer has a unique ID, name, email, address, and shipping information. Each order has a unique ID, customer ID, order date, shipping address, and total amount. Each order can have multiple items. An order item specifies the product ID, quantity, and price. Each order has associated payment information, including payment method, transaction ID, and payment status. Customers can leave reviews for products, including a rating and a text comment. The platform can offer promotions and discounts on products. State any assumptions you have that affects your design. Clearly indicate primary keys and the cardinalities with which an entity participates in a relationship with a pair of (minimum, maximum) value. OR Page 1 of 5 2.b) 3. Map the following ER diagram into relational schema(s) and specify all the relevant primarx keys and foreign keys. Exam , (I, !\\J (O,N) (1, 1) Doctor (1, 1) (J, I) Suppose we have a database for an investment firm, consisting of the following attributes: B- Broker, • 0 - Office of a broker I - Investor S-Stock Q - Quantity of stock owned by an investor D - Dividend paid by a stock. Hence, the overall schema is R = (B, 0, I, S, Cl, D). Assume that the following functional dependencies are required to hold on this database. FD= {I ➔ B, IS➔ Q B ➔ 0, S ➔ D} i) List all the candidate keys for R. ii) List the prime and non-prime attributes iii) Classify to which normal form the present form of Relation R belongs to and justify the answer. iv) Identify the FD' s which violates the property of a particular normal form and perform lossless-join decomposition of R into subsequent normal forms (continue up to BCNF).

S.a) Suppose we start with an empty B+ tree and keys arrive in the following order: 23;7; 12, 20, 45, 30, 9, 14, 70, 25, 19, 8, 21, 17, 84. Construct a B+ tree of order 3. Delete 23, 9, 30, 20, 25 fro~ th~·tree. Display'the resultant tree after each deletion. OR 5.b) i) Suppose that extendable hashing is being used on a database file that contains [SJ records with the following search key values: 8, 16,·4, 3, 14, 11, 1~, 23, 42, 21. Construct the extendable hash structure for this file using the lowest-bits for the hash function (after converting the numbers into its binary form). That is, records in a bucket of local depth'd' agree on their rightmost 'n' bits. For example, the key 3 (0011) and 11 (1011) agree on their rightmost 3 bits (011). Each bucket can hold two records. Answer the followings based on the constructed extendable hash structure. 1) What is the global depth of the resulting directory? 2) What is the local depth of the bucket contains key 14? ii) Consider the following Publication Database Author Author Pa blintioo author id first_a:1we 13st_aarue author id pub id author nos 1 John ~kCarthy 1 1 1 2 Dennis Ritchie 2 2 1 3 Ken Thompson 3 :?

For each schedule, draw the corresponding precedence graph. If the schedule is conflict-serializable, show all the conflict-equivalent serial schedules. If the schedule is not serializable, provide an initial DB state and some semantics (pseudo-code) for the transactions for which no serial schedule has the- same net effect. a) S1 = rl{A) r2(A) wl(A) w2(A) b) S2 = rl(A) r2(B) w3(A) r2(A) rl(B) c) S3 = rl(A) w2(A) wl(A) r3(A) ii) Based on the scenarios given below, find out appropriate ACID property the f 4] scenarios are referring to and discuss various validation strategies to test those scenarios. a) A bank account has an initial balance of $100. A transaction transfers $50 to another account. The database must ensure that the total balance of all accounts remains consistent before and after the transaction. b) The system experiences a power outage during a transaction. The transaction should be recoverable upon system restart. c) Multiple customers are trying to purchase· the last available item of a product. The system should ensure that only one customer is able to successfully purchase the item, preventing race conditions. d) A customer places an order for multiple items. The transaction should either be fully committed (all items are added to the order and payment is processed) or fully rolled back (no changes are made to the database). 7. Define conflict serializable, recoverable, cascadeless, and strict schedules. For each of the following schedules, state which of the above mentioned properties hold. Justify your answer. a) S1: Rl(X), W2(X), Wl(X), A2, Cl b) S2: Rl(X), W2(X), Wl(X), C2, Cl c) S3: Rl(X), R2(X), Wl(X), Cl, W2(X), C2 d) $4: Wl(X), R2(X), Wl(X), C2, Al e) Ss: Wl(X), R2(Y), Rl(Y), R2(X), Cl, C2 f) 55: Rl(X), R2(X), Cl, W2(X), C2 Page 4 of 5 ( 9.
