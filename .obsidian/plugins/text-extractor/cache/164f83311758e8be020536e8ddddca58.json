A connection between two stations is a dedicated path made of one or more links. However, each connection uses only one dedicated channel on each link. Each link is normally divided into n channels by using FDM or TDM. Three Phases Efficiency Delay Circuit-Switched Technology in Telephone Networks Topics discussed in this section: 5 A circuit-switched network is made of a set of switches connected by physical links, in which each link is divided into n channels. Note 6 • Circuit switching is a technique that directly connects the sender and the receiver in an unbroken path. • Telephone switching equipment, for example, establishes a path that connects the caller's telephone to the receiver’s telephone by making a physical connection. • With this type of switching technique, once a connection is established, a dedicated path exists between both ends until the connection is terminated. • Routing decisions must be made when the circuit is first established, but there are no decisions made after that time. 7 Figure 8.3 A trivial circuit-switched network 8 In circuit switching, the resources need to be reserved during the setup phase; the resources remain dedicated for the entire duration of data transfer until the teardown phase. Note 9 As a trivial example, let us use a circuit-switched network to connect eight telephones in a small area. Communication is through 4-kHz voice channels. We assume that each link uses FDM to connect a maximum of two voice channels. The bandwidth of each link is then 8 kHz. Figure 8.4 shows the situation. Telephone 1 is connected to telephone 7; 2 to 5; 3 to 8; and 4 to 6. Of course the situation may change when new connections are made. The switch controls the connections. Example 8.1 10 Figure 8.4 Circuit-switched network used in Example 8.1 11 As another example, consider a circuit-switched network that connects computers in two remote offices of a private company. The offices are connected using a T-1 line leased from a communication service provider. There are two 4 × 8 (4 inputs and 8 outputs) switches in this network. For each switch, four output ports are folded into the input ports to allow communication between computers in the same office. Four other output ports allow communication between the two offices. Figure 8.5 shows the situation. Example 8.2 12 Figure 8.5 Circuit-switched network used in Example 8.2 13 Figure 8.6 Delay in a circuit-switched network 14 8-2 DATAGRAM NETWORKS In data communications, we need to send messages from one end system to another. If the message is going to pass through a packet-switched network, it needs to be divided into packets of fixed or variable size. The size of the packet is determined by the network and the governing protocol. Routing Table Efficiency Delay Datagram Networks in the Internet Topics discussed in this section: 15 In a packet-switched network, there is no resource reservation; resources are allocated on demand. Note 16 Figure 8.7 A datagram network with four switches (routers) 17 Figure 8.8 Routing table in a datagram network 18 A switch in a datagram network uses a routing table that is based on the destination address. Note 19 The destination address in the header of a packet in a datagram network remains the same during the entire journey of the packet. Note 2021 Figure 8.9 Delay in a datagram network 22 Switching in the Internet is done by using the datagram approach to packet switching at the network layer. Note 23 In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is- 4 bytes 6 bytes 7 bytes 9 bytes 24 8-3 VIRTUAL-CIRCUIT NETWORKS A virtual-circuit network is a cross between a circuit- switched network and a datagram network. It has some characteristics of both. Addressing Three Phases Efficiency Delay Circuit-Switched Technology in WANs Topics discussed in this section: 25 Figure 8.10 Virtual-circuit network 26 Figure 8.11 Virtual-circuit identifier 27 Figure 8.12 Switch and tables in a virtual-circuit network 28 Figure 8.13 Source-to-destination data transfer in a virtual-circuit network 29 In virtual-circuit switching, all packets belonging to the same source and destination travel the same path; but the packets may arrive at the destination with different delays if resource allocation is on demand. Note 30 Figure 8.16 Delay in a virtual-circuit network 31 Switching at the data link layer in a switched WAN is normally implemented by using virtual-circuit techniques. Note 32 Packet Switching Circuit Switching In packet switching data is divided into packets, and packets is sent independently. There is a dedicated path for each packet in circuit switching. In Packet switching, data is processed at all intermediate nodes including the source system. In-Circuit switching, data is processed at the source system only. The delay between data units in packet switching is not uniform. The delay between data units in circuit switching is uniform. Packet switching is less reliable. Circuit switching is more reliable. Transmission of the data is done not only by the source but also by the intermediate routers. Transmission of the data is done by the source. Less wastage of resources. Wastage of resources is more in Circuit Switching. In Packet Switching there is no physical path between the source and the destination. In-Circuit Switching there is a physical path between the source and the destination. Call setup is not required in packet switching. Call setup is required in circuit switching. Packet switching requires complex protocols for delivery. Circuit switching requires simple protocols for delivery. Latency is high in Packet switching. Latency is low in circuit switching. Littel bit more overheating in packet switching. Overheading is low in circuit switching. Transmission media  communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through the electromagnetic signals.  Some factors need to be considered for designing the transmission media  Bandwidth  Impairment  Interferences. Causes Of Transmission Impairment 35 Figure 3.26 Attenuation 36 Suppose a signal travels through a transmission medium and its power is reduced to one-half. This means that P2 is (1/2)P1. In this case, the attenuation (loss of power) can be calculated as Example 3.26 A loss of 3 dB (–3 dB) is equivalent to losing one-half the power. 37 A signal travels through an amplifier, and its power is increased 10 times. This means that P2 = 10P1 . In this case, the amplification (gain of power) can be calculated as Example 3.27 38 The loss in a cable is usually defined in decibels per kilometer (dB/km). If the signal at the beginning of a cable with −0.3 dB/km has a power of 2 mW, what is the power of the signal at 5 km? Solution The loss in the cable in decibels is 5 × (−0.3) = −1.5 dB. We can calculate the power as Example 3.30 39 Figure 3.28 Distortion 40 Figure 3.29 Noise SNR = AVG SIGNAL POWER / AVG NOISE POWER SNRdB = 10Log10SNR 41 The power of a signal is 10 mW and the power of the noise is 1 μW; what are the values of SNR and SNRdB ? Solution The values of SNR and SNRdB can be calculated as follows: Example 3.31 Performance Bandwidth Throughput The throughput is a measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network.
