It is referred to as the “First reader-writer” problem. (no reader kept waiting unless writer has permission to use shared object)  The “Second reader-writer” problem is a variation the first reader-writer problem that state: • Once a writer is ready to write, no “newly arrived reader” is allowed to read.  Both the first and second may result in starvation. leading to even more variations  Problem is solved on some systems by kernel providing reader-writer locks 7a.11 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2018Operating System Concepts – 10th Edition Dining-Philosophers Problem  N philosophers’ sit at a round table with a bowel of rice in the middle.  They spend their lives alternating thinking and eating.  They do not interact with their neighbors.  Occasionally try to pick up 2 chopsticks (one at a time) to eat from bowl • Need both to eat, then release both when done  In the case of 5 philosophers, the shared data  Bowl of rice (data set)  Semaphore chopstick [5] initialized to 1 7a.12 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2018Operating System Concepts – 10th Edition Dining-Philosophers Problem Algorithm  Semaphore Solution  The structure of Philosopher i: while (true){ wait (chopstick[i] ); wait (chopStick[ (i + 1) % 5] ); /* eat for awhile */ signal (chopstick[i] ); signal (chopstick[ (i + 1) % 5] ); /* think for awhile */ }  What is the problem with this algorithm? 7a.13 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2018Operating System Concepts – 10th Edition Monitor Solution to Dining Philosophers monitor DiningPhilosophers { enum { THINKING; HUNGRY, EATING) state [5] ; condition self [5]; void pickup (int i) { state[i] = HUNGRY;//philosopher is hungry// test(i); //try to get both chopsticks// if (state[i] != EATING) self[i].wait; //wait if not allowed to eat// } void putdown (int i) { state[i] = THINKING; //philosopher stops eating// // test left and right neighbors test((i + 4) % 5); //left neighbor// test((i + 1) % 5); //right neighbor// } 7a.14 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2018Operating System Concepts – 10th Edition Solution to Dining Philosophers (Cont.) void test (int i) { if ((state[(i + 4) % 5] != EATING) && //left not eating// (state[i] == HUNGRY) && //I is hungry// (state[(i + 1) % 5] != EATING) ) { //right not eating// state[i] = EATING ; //allow philosopher i to eat// self[i].signal () ; // wake up I if waiting// } } initialization_code() { for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) state[i] = THINKING; } } 7a.15 Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne ©2018Operating System Concepts – 10th Edition  Each philosopher “i” invokes the operations pickup() and putdown() in the following sequence: DiningPhilosophers.pickup(i); /** EAT **/ DiningPhilosophers.putdown(i);  No deadlock, but starvation is possible Solution to Dining Philosophers (Cont.)
