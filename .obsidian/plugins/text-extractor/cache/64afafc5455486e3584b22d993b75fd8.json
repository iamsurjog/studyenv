[ 2 Marks] Architecture of Learning based Agent [2 Marks] Following are the major components of Leanring based Agent: [ 1 Marks] i. Learning element is responsible for making improvements. ii. Performance element is responsible for selecting external actions. iii. Critic provides feedback on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the future. iv. Problem generator is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.

Explain each step of the genetic algorithm with correct terminology in detail using the eight- queen problem and appropriate examples. Calculations must be provided along with the steps when necessary. 10 CO 2 BL 6 Ans wer Genetic Algorithm: Genetic algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm inspired from Darwin’s theory of Natural evolution. In Genetic algorithm, we encode each state of a search problem with a string (binary/decimal/hexadecimal/alphabets etc.). We initialize with a population of individuals. Further, we define a fitness function to estimate how good an individual is w.r.t. to target goals. Using fitness function, we select the group parents to participate in production next generation of individuals using crossover and mutation. We keep on repeating the process until the stopping criteria is met. The flowchart of Genetic Algorithm can be illustrated using the diagram given below. 8 - Queen problem: Arrange the 8 queens in 8*8 Chess board such that no queens attach each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). With respect to solving 8 Queen problems using Genetic algorithm, we will demonstrate following steps: i. Define Encoding mechanism: Representing an individual. ii. Define Fitness Function: to estimate how good an individual of a population is. iii. Initialize a population. iv. Calculate the Fitness of all individuals of the population using fitness function. v. Selection of parent for generating new child. vi. Cross of selected parents vii. Mutation of selected parents viii. Repeat step (iv) to (vii) until the stopping criteria is met. i. Defining Encoding Mechanism for 8 Queen problem ii. Define a fitness function. iii. Initialize a population (assume population size =4) iv. Calculate the Fitness of all individuals of the population using fitness function. v. Selection of parent for generation of new child vi. Crossover between selected parents vii. Mutation of selected parents viii. Stopping Criteria Steps (iv) to (vii) are repeated until highest fitness score ( 28 in this case) is achieved","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
