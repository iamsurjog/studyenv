Robustness • ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input • Methods to test robustness – Fuzz testing – Fault injection •Building robust systems that encompass every point of possible failure is difficult because of the vast quantity of possible inputs and input combinations •Generalizing test cases • Distributed system - suffer from various types of hardware failure – failure of a link – failure of a site – loss of a message Portability • ability of an application to run properly in a different platform – usability of the same software in different environments. Compatibility • capacity for two systems to work together without having to be altered  – Eg: if word processor applications are compatible, the user should be able to open their document files in either product • Compatibility issues come up when users are using the same type of software for a task, such as word processors, that cannot communicate with each other. • due to a difference in their versions or because they are made by different companies","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
