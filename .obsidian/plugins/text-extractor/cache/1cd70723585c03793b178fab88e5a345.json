Actual window size = minimum (rwnd, cwnd) rwnd- receiver window; cwnd- congestion window Congestion policy • TCP's general policy for handling congestion is based on three phases: • Slow start, • Congestion avoidance, • Congestion detection. Slow start • Slow Start: Exponential Increase • One of the algorithms used in TCP congestion control is called slow start. • This algorithm is based on the idea that the size of the congestion window (cwnd) starts with one maximum segment size (MSS). • In the slow-start algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases exponentially until it reaches a threshold. Congestion avoidance • Congestion avoidance- which undergoes an additive increase instead of an exponential one. • When the size of the congestion window reaches the slow- start threshold, the slow-start phase stops and the additive phase begins. In the congestion avoidance algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases additively until congestion is detected Congestion Detection • Congestion Detection: Multiplicative Decrease • If congestion occurs, the congestion window size must be decreased. • The only way the sender can guess that congestion has occurred is by the need to retransmit a segment. • However, retransmission can occur in one of two cases: when a timer times out or when three ACKs are received. • I. If a time-out occurs, there is a stronger possibility of congestion; a segment has probably been dropped in the network, and there is no news about the sent segments. Congestion Control in Frame Relay • BECN The backward explicit congestion notification (BECN) • FECN The forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) BECN • The backward explicit congestion notification (BECN) bit warns the sender of congestion in the network. • One might ask how this is accomplished since the frames are traveling away from the sender. • In fact, there are two methods: • The switch can use response frames from the receiver (full- duplex mode), or • Else the switch can use a predefined connection to send special frames for this specific purpose. • The sender can respond to this warning by simply reducing the data rate. FECN • The forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) bit is used to warn the receiver of congestion in the network. • It might appear that the receiver cannot do anything to relieve the congestion. • However, the Frame Relay protocol assumes that the sender and receiver are communicating with each other and are using some type of flow control at a higher level. • For example, if there is an acknowledgment mechanism at this higher level, the receiver can delay the acknowledgment, thus forcing the sender to slow down","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
