To understand the concepts of File system and structure of the database; Designing an Entity-Relationship model for a real-life application and Mapping a database schema from the ER model. 2. To differentiate various normal forms, evaluate relational schemas for design qualities and optimize a query. 3. To impart the working methodologies of transaction management, understand concurrency control, recovery, indexing, access methods and fundamental view on unstructured data and its management. Course Outcomes On completion of this course, student should be able to: 1. Comprehend the role of database management system in an organization and design the structure and operation of the relational data model. 2. Develop a database project depending on the business requirements, considering various design issues. 3. List the concepts of indexing and accessing methods. 4. Explain the concept of a database transaction processing and comprehend the concept of database facilities including concurrency control, backup and recovery. 5. Review the fundamental view on unstructured data and describe other emerging database technologies.
