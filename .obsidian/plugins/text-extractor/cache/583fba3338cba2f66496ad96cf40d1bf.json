Data communication characteristics • Delivery • Accuracy • Timeliness • Jitter Data communication characteristics Components Network • A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links. • A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network. • Point to Point: • Between two devices. • Entire capacity is reserved between two devices • Multi Point: • Broadcast connection • Two or more share a single link • Capacity is shared • Spatial( link shared simultaneously) • Temporal(shared on turn basis) Networking Protocols • Message encoded(Signal conversion) • Message transmitted(Channel) • Message received(unicast, multicast, broadcast) • Peer- Peer network(one to one) • Client- Server network(server to client) Mesh Topology No of links = n(n-1)/2 Star topology Bus topologyRing topology Hybrid TopologyComponents of computer network • Nodes(End nodes-computers, printers, cameras. Intermediate node-Switches, Hub, Routers) • Media(Medium of transmission-Wired, Wireless) • Services(Gaming ,e-mail, google drive(storage), file sharing, instant communication, World wide web) Wired medium • Ethernet Straight through cable-(Connection btw two different nodes) • Ethernet crossover cable-(connections between same kind of nodes) • FOC(Fiber Optic cable) • Coaxial Cable • USB cable Wireless medium • Infra red(Tv remote) • Radio waves( Bluetooth, WiFi) • Microwaves (Cellullar Systems) • Satellite (GPS) Classification of computer networks • Local Area Network(LAN)-(limited area) • Wired LAN(Ethernet-Hub, Switch) • Wireless LAN(Wi-Fi) • Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)(connects network geographically in small range, btw two LAN) • Wide Area Network(WAN)- connects wide goegraphical area- telecommunication network • Internet (wide WAN) IPv4, IPv6, MAC • IP address(ipconfig) • Location based • 4 octets(32 bits- decimal) • 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 • Manual or dynamic MAC ADDRESS(ipconfig/all) • Name of the device • Physical address • Not on locality • UNIQUE • 48 bits(- . :) hexadecimal Port address port number • Identify the process(resmon-resource monitoring) • Communicate the end point • Assigned by OS • 0-65535","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
