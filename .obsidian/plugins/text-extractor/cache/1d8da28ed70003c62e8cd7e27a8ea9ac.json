You’ve just described different dimensions of intelligence. ▪Interestingly, in AI, all of these behaviors arise from how we structure the agent — its internal architecture and programming. 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 7 Agent = Architecture + Program • Architecture: The machinery it runs on. • Program: The software component that implements the agent’s behavior. What is an Agent ? ▪ Is this Agent ? ▪ Hardware (Architecture) 7/17/2025 Computer Science 8 Agent = Architecture + Program • Architecture: The machinery it runs on. • Program: The software component that implements the agent’s behavior. function TABLE-DRIVEN-AGENT(percept) returns an action persistent: percepts, a sequence, initially empty table, a table of actions, indexed by percept sequences, initially fully specified append percept to the end of percepts action ← LOOKUP(percepts, table) return action ❑ Behaviour (Program) The Agent Program ▪ Explain the logic-based structure: ▪ Perception → Action ▪ Percept to Action Mapping [A, clean] => Right [A, dirty] => Clean [B, clean] => Left [B, dirty] => Clean function REFLEX-VACUUM-AGENT([location, status]) returns an action if status = Dirty then return Clean else if location = A then return Right else if location = B then return Left 7/17/2025 Computer Science 9 Type of Agents ▪ Simple reflex agent ▪Model-based reflex agent ▪Goal based Agents ▪Utility based Agents ▪Learning based Agents 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 10 • Let’s now look at the various types of agents — from the simplest reflex machines to advanced learning agents — and understand what gives them their ‘intelligence.” • Let us understand each agent with architecture, algorithmic logic, properties, and real-world use case. Simple Reflex Agent ▪ Example: Fire/Smoke Detector ▪ Acts immediately when it sense smoke ▪ No memory, just condition, action, rules. • React to current percept using condition-action rules. • No internal memory. ▪ Algorithm: IF condition THEN action ▪ Use Case: Smoke detector, dishwasher. 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 11 https://github.com/aimacode/aima- pseudocode/tree/master Simple Reflex Agent 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 12 Fig: Architecture Diagram of Simple Reflex Agent 𝒇𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 SIMPLE-REFLEX- AGENT(percept ) returns an action 𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕 rules, a set of condition– action rules state ← INTERPRET-INPUT(percept ) rule ← RULE-MATCH( state, rules) action ← rule.ACTION 𝒓𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏 action Fig: Algorithm of Simple Reflex Agent Model based reflex Agent ▪ Example: Robot Vacuum Cleaner (e.g. Roomba) ▪ Uses a map of the environment to avoid obstacles and clean efficiently. ▪ Maintain internal state of the world. ▪ Handles partially observable environments. ▪ Architecture: Current Percept + Internal Model → Action ▪ Use Case: Indoor robot vacuum (e.g., Roomba with obstacle memory) 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 13 Model based reflex Agent 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 14 Fig: Architecture Diagram of Model based Reflex Agent Model based reflex Agent 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 15 𝒇𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 MODEL-BASED-REFLEX-AGENT(percept ) returns an action 𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕 state, the agent’s current conception of world state, transition_model, a description of how next state depends on current state and action sensor_model ← a description of how the current world state is reflected in the agent’s percepts rules ← a set of condition–action rules action ← the most recent action, initially none state ← UPDATE-STATE(state, action, percept, transition_model, sensor_model) rule ← RULE-MATCH( state, rules) action ← rule.ACTION 𝒓𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏 action Fig: Algorithm of Model based Reflex Agent Goal-Based Agents ▪ Example: Autonomous Delivery Drone ▪ Plans its route dynamically to reach a destination while avoiding hazards. ▪ Acts based on desired outcomes (goals). ▪ Needs search and planning. ▪ Algorithm: A* Search / Planning Graph ▪ Use Case: Pathfinding in Google Maps, automated delivery drones. ▪ Think-Pair-Share: \"Why might a goal-based agent be inefficient in real-time games?\" 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 16 Goal based reflex Agent 7/17/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306) 17 Fig: Architecture Diagram of Goal based Agent Actuators Utility-Based Agents ▪ Example: Stock Trading Bot ▪ Chooses trade that maximizes expected financial return not just reaching a goal. ▪ Measures how good each state is. ▪ Maximizes expected utility. ▪ Concepts: Utility Function, Optimization ▪ Use Case: AI in trading bots, recommendation systems. ▪ Exercise: Rate 3 outcomes for a recommender system.
