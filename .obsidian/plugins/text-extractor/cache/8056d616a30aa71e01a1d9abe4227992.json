(i)A multiprocessor system contains more than one CPU (also known as processor) and they work in parallel. This is called Simultaneous Multiprocessing (SMP). Multiprocessor systems have a special type of motherboard which has several CPU sockets. A multicore system contains more than one execution core on one CPU. The exact meaning of multicore depends on the architecture, but essentially a certain subset of the CPU's components is replicated, so that several cores can work in parallel on isolated CPU operations. This is called Chip-level Multiprocessing (CMP). A multicore chip can have a dedicated execution unit and L1 cache for a core and a shared L2 cache for the entire CPU. Multiprocessor means having several CPUs whereas multicore means having several cores. (ii) Privacy and Authentication at all levels ( Protection and Security) The operating system controls all a computer system's hardware resources, including processor, memory, storage space, network controller, peripherals, and user input/output. As such, it controls many resources that need protection. Some of the tools an OS often utilizes include user identity management, anti-malware software, network firewalls, and encryption. 5+5 CO 1 BL 2 The operating system operates at many levels of security. It controls access to hard drives, network controllers, and user interfaces. Therefore, it participates in security at the data, user, and network levels. It also plays a role in mitigating damage at the physical security level through the use of backup and restore operations. 2. Definition - Programming interface to the services provided by the OS. A system call is a request from computer software to an operating system's kernel. (1 mark) Need - System calls allow user-level processes to request services of the operating system Simplicity – No need to write complex code (1 mark) Parameter passing methods (3 marks) Three general methods used to pass parameters to the OS ◦ Simplest: pass the parameters in registers  In some cases, may be more parameters than registers ◦ Parameters stored in a block, or table, in memory, and address of block passed as a parameter in a register  This approach taken by Linux and Solaris ◦ Parameters placed, or pushed, onto the stack by the program and popped off the stack by the operating system ◦ Block and stack methods do not limit the number or length of parameters being passed (ii) Instruction Mode (5 marks) 5+5 CO 1 BL 4 3. 10 CO 1 BL 5 4. 10 CO 2 BL 3 5. 10 CO 2 BL 3","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
