To describe the trade-offs between conflicting objectives in large scale system design. 3. To develop the knowledge for application of the various design issues and services. Course Outcome On completion of this course, student should be able to: 1. Interpret the evolution of OS functionality, structures, layers and apply various types of system calls of various process states. 2. Design scheduling algorithms to compute and compare various scheduling criteria. 3. Apply and analyze communication between inter process and synchronization techniques. 4. Implement page replacement algorithms, memory management problems and segmentation. Differentiate the file systems for applying different allocation, access technique, representing virtualization and providing protection and security to OS. Indicative Experiments 1. Study of Basic Linux Commands 2. Implement your own bootloader program that helps a computer to boot an OS. 3. Shell Programming (I/O, Decision making, Looping, Multi-level branching) 4. Creating child process using fork () system call, Orphan and Zombie process creation 5. Simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority and Round Robin) 6. Implement process synchronization using semaphores / monitors. 7. Simulation of Banker s algorithm to check whether the given system is in safe state or not. Also check whether addition resource requested can be granted immediately 8. Parallel Thread management using Pthreads library. Implement a data parallelism using multi-threading 9. Dynamic memory allocation algorithms - First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit algorithms 10. Page Replacement Algorithms FIFO, LRU and Optimal 11. Implement a file locking mechanism. 12.
