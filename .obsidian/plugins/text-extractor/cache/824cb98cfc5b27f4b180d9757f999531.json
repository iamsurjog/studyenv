To impart artificial intelligence principles, techniques and its history. 2. To assess the applicability, strengths, and weaknesses of the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods in solving engineering problems 3. To develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems Course Outcomes On completion of this course, student should be able to: 1. Evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and describe their foundations. 2. Apply basic principles of AI in solutions that require problem-solving, inference, perception, knowledge representation and learning. 3. Demonstrate knowledge of reasoning, uncertainty, and knowledge representation for solving real-world problems 4.
