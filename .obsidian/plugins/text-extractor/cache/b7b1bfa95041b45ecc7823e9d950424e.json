Data is organized into tables and rows, with relationships established between tables. Data redundancy Data redundancy is high, as each file is stored in multiple directories. Data redundancy is low, as data is stored in a centralized location and is not repeated. Data Integrity Data integrity is low, as there is no built-in mechanism for enforcing data constraints. Data integrity is high, as constraints can be set on data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Scalability Scalability is limited, as the file system becomes slow and unwieldy as the number of files increases. Scalability is good, as databases can handle large amounts of data and can be optimized for performance.  Difference between File System and DBMS Feature File System DBMS Security Security is basic, with limited control over who can access files. Security is robust, with fine- grained control over who can access and modify data. Query capabilities Query capabilities are limited, with no support for complex queries or transactions. Query capabilities are strong, with support for complex queries and transactions. Data sharing Data sharing is difficult, as multiple users must access the same physical file. Data sharing is easy, as multiple users can access the same data simultaneously through the database management system. Backup and recovery Backup and recovery is time- consuming and difficult, as each file must be backed up individually. Backup and recovery is straightforward, as the database management system handles backup and recovery operations. Impact and Importance of Databases • Databases have greatly influenced the widespread use of computers. • Critical role in nearly all fields involving computer usage, including: • Business • E-commerce • Social media • Engineering • Medicine • Genetics • Law • Education • Library science Impact and Importance of Databases Key Features of DBMS  Data Modeling: Tools to create and modify data models, defining the structure and relationships within the database.  Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficient mechanisms for storing data and executing queries to retrieve it quickly.  Concurrency Control: Ensures multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflicts.  Data Integrity and Security: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and secure data, including access controls and encryption.  Backup and Recovery: Protects data with regular backups and enables recovery in case of system failures. What is a Database? • A database is defined as a collection of related data. • Data refers to known facts that: • Can be recorded • Have implicit meaning Examples of Databases in Daily Life •Mobile phones store data like names, phone numbers, and addresses. •These are often managed by simple built-in database software. •Similar data can be stored: •In an indexed address book •On a computer hard drive using software like Microsoft Access or Excel Implicit Properties of a Database 1. Represents a Real-World Aspect (Miniworld/UoD) Changes in the real world are reflected in the database. 2. Logically Coherent with Meaning Random data is not a database; data must be related and meaningful. 3. Purpose-Driven Design Built for a specific purpose, with a clear audience and intended applications. Why Accurate Representation Matters  Real-world events (e.g., purchases, births) must be quickly updated in the database to ensure accuracy and reliability.  A database should always reflect the current state of its miniworld. Size and Complexity Can Vary  Small: Address book with a few hundred entries.  Medium: Library catalog with ~500,000 records.  Large: • Facebook: Tracks billions of users, relationships, posts, and privacy settings. • Amazon: Stores data on 60+ million users and millions of items across 42+ terabytes of data Types of Databases • Manual databases: e.g., a library card catalog. • Computerized databases: Managed by: Custom programs or A Database Management System (DBMS). What is a DBMS (Database Management System)? • Software that allows users to define, build, manipulate, and share a database. • Handles: • Defining: Data types, structures, and constraints. • Constructing: Storing data on physical storage. • Manipulating: Querying, updating, and reporting. • Sharing: Multiple users/programs can access simultaneously. • Protecting: Against hardware/software failures and unauthorized access. • Maintaining: Supports long-term evolution of the database. DBMS Components • Meta-data: Descriptive data stored in a catalog or dictionary. • Queries: Retrieve specific data. • Transactions: Involve both reading and writing data. General vs. Special-Purpose DBMS • General-purpose DBMS: Can be used for many applications. • Custom-built DBMS: Tailored for a specific task (e.g., airline reservations). What is data, database, DBMS ?  Data: Known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning; raw  Database: a highly organized, interrelated, and structured set of data about a particular enterprise  Controlled by a database management system (DBMS)  DBMS  Set of programs to access the data  An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use  Database systems are used to manage collections of data that are:  Highly valuable  Relatively large  Accessed by multiple users and applications, often at the same time.  A modern database system is a complex software system whose task is to manage a large, complex collection of data.  Databases touch all aspects of our lives Database system environment Some mini-world relationships: SECTIONs are of specific COURSEs STUDENTs take SECTIONs COURSEs have prerequisite COURSEs INSTRUCTORs teach SECTIONs COURSEs are offered by DEPARTMENTs STUDENTs major in DEPARTMENTs Examples of Queries (Retrieving Data) These are requests to extract specific information from the database: •Retrieve the transcript : a list of all courses and grades of ‘Smith’. •List the names of students who took the section of the ‘Database’ course offered in fall 2008, and their grades in that section. •List the prerequisites of the ‘Database’ course. Examples of Updates (Modifying Data) These are operations that change data stored in the database: •Change the class of ‘Smith’ to sophomore. •Create a new section for the ‘Database’ course for this semester. •Enter a grade of ‘A’ for ‘Smith’ in the ‘Database’ section of last semester. These informal queries and updates must be precisely specified in the query language of the DBMS (Database Management System) before the system can process them. Database structure & few sample data records Steps in Database Design and Development 1. Requirements Specification and Analysis • First phase in designing a new application or new database. • Involves identifying and documenting all the data and functionality needs. 2. Conceptual Design • The documented requirements are transformed into a conceptual model. • This is typically done using tools like the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. • Conceptual design is: • Easy to understand • Maintainable and modifiable 3. Logical Design (relational DBMS) • The conceptual model is translated into a logical data model. • This model is suitable for implementation in a commercial DBMS. 4. Physical Design • Final stage where technical details are added for: • Storage methods • Access paths • The database is implemented, populated with actual data, and continuously maintained. Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 1. Self-Describing Nature of a Database System  A database system stores not only the actual data but also a complete description of the database structure and constraints.  This descriptive information is stored in the DBMS catalog as meta- data, which includes:  File structures  Data item types and formats  Constraints  The DBMS software and users refer to this catalog to understand how to access and interpret the data.  This allows general-purpose DBMS software to work with different databases (e.g., university, banking, company databases) without being rewritten.  In contrast, traditional file systems embed structure within application programs, requiring rewrites when data structures change.  Some newer systems, like NOSQL databases, use self-describing data formats where data and structure are stored together. Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 1. Self-Describing Nature of a Database System Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 2. Insulation Between Programs and Data, and Data Abstraction Program-Data Independence •In traditional systems, changes to data structure (e.g., adding Birth_date to a STUDENT record) require modifying all dependent programs. •In a DBMS, structure is stored in the catalog, so programs continue to work after changes—this is program-data independence. Program-Operation Independence •In object-oriented and object-relational databases, operations (methods) on data are defined with:  An interface (name and parameter types)  An implementation (actual logic) •Applications invoke operations by interface, regardless of how they are implemented— this is program-operation independence. Data Abstraction •A DBMS provides a conceptual view of the data, hiding physical storage details. •Users interact with logical entities like STUDENT.Name, without needing to know byte positions or storage paths. •This abstraction is achieved using data models (e.g., relational, object-based), which define objects, properties, and relationships. •In object-oriented models, even behavior (operations) like CALCULATE_GPA can be abstracted. Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 2. Insulation Between Programs and Data, and Data Abstraction Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 3. Support of Multiple Views of the Data •A single database may have many types of users, each requiring a different view of the data. •A view can be:  A subset of the database  A virtual table derived from base data (not stored physically) •For example:  A user printing transcripts may only need student names and grades.  Another user may need to check if students met all prerequisites for a course. •Views improve:  Security (limit access to sensitive data)  User convenience (simplified interfaces)  Application customization Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 3. Support of Multiple Views of the Data Figure 1.5(a). A second user, who is interested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each course for which the student registers, may require the view shown in Figure 1.5(b). Key Characteristics of the Database Approach 4. Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing A multiuser DBMS supports simultaneous data access by many users/applications. This avoids data duplication and ensures data consistency through controlled access. 🔸 Concurrency Control Required when multiple users access or modify data at the same time. Example: Multiple agents booking seats on the same flight—the DBMS ensures one seat is assigned to only one passenger. 🔸 Transaction Management A transaction is a logical unit of work involving database operations (e.g., read, write). Key transaction properties:  Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are completed or none are.  Isolation: Transactions appear to run independently, even when concurrent. 🔸 OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) Common in banking, airline booking, shopping, etc., where multiple users perform transactions concurrently. The DBMS ensures efficiency and correctness in such high-volume, real-time environments. Actors on the Scene In large organizations, a wide range of people interact with a database system— each with different roles, responsibilities, and levels of technical knowledge. These people are known as actors on the scene because they are actively involved in the database's operation and use. Actors on the Scene 1. Database Administrators (DBAs) Manage the database and DBMS software. Responsibilities:  Authorize user access.  Monitor and coordinate database usage.  Acquire hardware and software resources.  Ensure security, data integrity, and performance. In large organizations, DBAs may lead a technical team handling these tasks. Actors on the Scene 2. Database Designers Design the overall database structure before implementation. Key tasks:  Identify what data needs to be stored.  Choose appropriate data structures.  Communicate with end users to gather requirements.  Create and integrate different user views into a unified database design. Often work under the DBA’s team. Actors on the Scene 3. End Users End users interact directly with the database. They fall into several categories: ▪️ Casual End Users Use the system occasionally. Run ad-hoc queries using a query interface. Typically mid- or upper-level managers. ▪️ Naive or Parametric End Users Use predefined, repeated transactions (called canned transactions). Have minimal DBMS knowledge; interact through apps or forms. Examples:  Bank tellers and customers checking balances or making deposits.  Reservation agents booking flights or hotel rooms.  Employees scanning packages in logistics.  Social media users posting and reading content. ▪️ Actors on the Scene 3. End Users • Sophisticated End Users Includes engineers, scientists, business analysts. Use advanced DBMS features to write complex queries or develop custom applications Standalone Users Maintain personal databases using ready-made software (e.g., financial tools). Typically use menu-driven or graphical interfaces. Become proficient in a specific software package. Actors on the Scene 4. System Analysts and Application Programmers (Software Engineers) •System Analysts:  Identify end user requirements, especially for naive users.  Design standardized canned transactions for frequent use. •Application Programmers:  Implement, test, debug, and maintain the programs developed by analysts.  Must understand the full capabilities of the DBMS to ensure optimal integration. Workers Behind the Scene A group of professionals who work behind the scenes to develop and support the database system environment. These individuals do not focus on the data itself, but on ensuring the DBMS runs efficiently and reliably. Workers Behind the Scene 1. DBMS System Designers and Implementers Design and build the core DBMS software as a complete package. Develop internal modules such as:  Catalog management  Query processing  User interfaces  Data access and buffering  Concurrency control  Recovery and security Ensure smooth integration with:  Operating systems  Programming language compilers A DBMS is a complex software system, and these professionals are crucial in constructing its functionality. Workers Behind the Scene 2. Tool Developers Create auxiliary software tools that enhance DBMS design, usability, and performance Tools may include:  Database design tools  Performance monitoring utilities  Natural language or graphical interfaces  Simulation or prototyping tools  Test data generators These tools are often developed by third-party vendors and may be purchased as optional add-ons. Workers Behind the Scene 3. Operators and Maintenance Personnel (System Admins) Ensure the hardware and software infrastructure supporting the DBMS is operational. Responsibilities:  Install, run, and maintain database-related systems.  Monitor system health and performance.  Apply software updates and backups. They maintain the technical environment for smooth DBMS operation but do not interact with the data itself. Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach In addition to the four primary characteristics of database systems (Section 1.3), a well-designed DBMS provides numerous benefits that enhance usability, security, efficiency, and scalability. 1. Controlling Redundancy Traditional systems store the same data in multiple files across departments, causing:  Duplication of effort  Wasted storage  Inconsistencies DBMS supports data normalization to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. In some cases, controlled redundancy (e.g., denormalization) is used to improve performance, and the DBMS enforces consistency across copies. Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach 2. Restricting Unauthorized Access Different users require different levels of access. DBMS provides a security and authorization subsystem that:  Creates user accounts and passwords  Specifies access rights (e.g., read-only or read-write) Access can also be restricted at the software level (e.g., only DBAs can run certain programs). 3. Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects DBMS stores complex objects (e.g., C++ or Java classes) persistently. This eliminates the need for manual serialization and deserialization. Solves the impedance mismatch problem between programming languages and data storage. Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach 4. Efficient Query Processing A DBMS must support fast access to data stored on disk. It uses:  Indexes (e.g., B-trees, hash structures)  Caching/buffering  Query optimization modules Helps retrieve and process queries quickly and efficiently. 5. Backup and Recovery The backup and recovery subsystem restores the database in case of:  System failures  Crashes during transactions  Catastrophic hardware issues (e.g., disk failure) Ensures data integrity and business continuity. Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach 6. Providing Multiple User Interfaces Different users have different needs:  Casual users: query languages (e.g., SQL)  Programmers: programming language APIs  Parametric users: forms or canned transactions  Standalone/mobile users: GUI apps or web interfaces Modern DBMSs offer GUIs and web-based interfaces. 7. Representing Complex Relationships Among Data Data can be related in many-to-many or hierarchical ways (e.g., students ↔ grades ↔ courses). DBMS can:  Represent these relationships explicitly  Enable easy querying and updating of related data Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach 8. Enforcing Integrity Constraints Enforces business rules and data validity, such as:  Data types (e.g., name = string, class = integer 1–5)  Key constraints (e.g., unique course numbers)  Referential integrity (e.g., foreign keys linking student to grade) Helps prevent invalid or inconsistent data. 9. Supporting Inferencing and Triggers Some systems support deductive rules to infer new data automatically. Triggers can execute actions in response to certain changes in data. Stored procedures and active rules automate tasks and maintain consistency. 10. Additional Organizational Benefits Enforcing Standards: Consistent naming, formatting, and data usage across departments. Reduced Development Time: Faster application development using reusable DBMS facilities. Flexibility: Schema changes can be made with minimal disruption. Real-Time Updates: Users access up-to-date data instantly. Economies of Scale: Centralized resources reduce overall costs and prevent duplication.
