Suppose you go for a test to find whether you have COVID-19 disease or not? to a lab. Let there be 1 out of 100 people in your county is affected with this disease. Assume that there is a 5% chance of you being tested falsely positive (i.e. you do not have the disease but the test comes positive). Also, there is a 10% chance that you have the disease but tested negative (i.e. you have the disease, but the test comes positive). Apply Bayes Rule to find out the probability of you being tested positive and actually having the disease. [5 M] B. Consider that 1% of the population in this world is having the COVID-19 disease. Assume that if you really have the disease, then there is a 95 % chance that you tested positive. Also, there is 1% chance that you have tested positive, even if you do not have the disease (because of inaccuracy of the test results). Using Bayes Rule find out the probability that you have tested positive and actually have the COVID-19 disease. [ 5 M] [CAT-2 Winter 2020-21] Q2. Using the probability values given in the table answer the following statements with proper justifications (5 Marks) [CAT-2 Winter 2023-24] A. Does the probability of wind increase given the probability of rain? B. What is the dependency between wind and Headache? Does the probability of wind remain unchanged given headache? C. . Is rain conditionally independent of Headache, given wind? Q3. Apply Naïve Bayes Classification for the given dataset of animals along with their attributes.

Q4. Consider the following dataset S.No Age Gender Income Education Occupation Credit Score 1 <40 Male High Graduate Professional Low 2 <40 Female Medium High School Managerial Low 3 >40 Male High Postgraduate Professional High 4 >40 Female High Postgraduate Professional High 5 >40 Male Low High School Skilled Low 6 <40 Female Medium Graduate Managerial Medium 7 <40 Male Medium Graduate Professional High 8 >40 Female High Postgraduate Managerial High 9 >40 Male High High School Skilled Low 10 <40 Female Medium Graduate Professional Medium 11 >40 Male Medium High School Skilled Medium 12 >40 Female Low Graduate Skilled High a) Using the provided dataset, which includes demographic information and credit scores of individuals, apply Naive Bayes classification to predict the credit score of a new individual based on their following demographic features: Age>40, Gender=Male, Income=Medium, Education=Graduate, Occupation=Skilled. [ 6 M] b) Based on the data given in the table answer the followings: (4 Marks) i) What is the probability that an individual has a High credit score given that they are Female and have a Postgraduate education? ii) Given that an individual has a High income and a Skilled occupation, what is the probability? [CAT-2 Winter 2023-24] [ BCSE306 L, Artificial Intelligence] [Dr. Durgesh Kumar] [15-09-2025] Page | 3 Q5. Suppose you live in London, England, and you notice that during the winter, it rains 50% of the time and that it is cloudy 80% of the time (sometimes it is cloudy without rain). You know, of course, that 100% of the time, if it is raining, then it is also cloudy. Using Bayes’ rule, compute the chances of rain, given that it is just cloudy. [4 M] [CAT-2 Winter 2023-24] Q6. A) Using the Naïve Bayes classifier diagnoses the person with symptoms (chills= y, running nose = n, Headache=mild, Fever= n) have flu or not?

One day they play a game together. In the first run, 65% of the grey eye ones, 82% of the blue-eyed ones and 50% of the children with other eye colour were selected. Now, if a child is selected randomly from the class, and we know that he/she was not in the first game, what is the probability that the child has blue eyes? [ 4 Marks] [CAT-2 Winter 2019-20 + CAT-2 Winter 2023-24] Q7. A) Explain Bayes' rule with a suitable example [ 3 M] B) In a reputed engineering college, there are 1000 students. Among them, 700 students got placement offers. Overall, it is seen that 82% of the candidates are strong in ‘C language’ among the selected candidates. In the class, 660 students are strong in ‘C language’. Sweta is strong in ‘C language’. How likely is she to get the placement offer? Map the scenario into a set of propositions and apply Bayes' rule to solve the problem. [7 M] [CAT-2 Fall 2024-25] Q8. Consider the following dataset that includes demographic information and symptoms for disease diagnosis: A) Using the dataset provided, apply Naive Bayes Classification to predict the diagnosis of a new individual based on the following features: Age Group: 30-40, Gender: Female, Fever: Yes, Cough: Yes, Fatigue: Yes, Sore Throat: No [ BCSE306 L, Artificial Intelligence] [Dr. Durgesh Kumar] [15-09-2025] Page | 4 S.No Age Group Gender Fever Cough Fatigue Sore Throat Diagnosis 1 30 Female Yes Yes Yes No Flu 2 30-40 Male Yes Yes No Yes COVID-19 3 >40 Female No Yes Yes Yes Allergies 4 <30 Male Yes No Yes No Flu 5 30-40 Female Yes Yes Yes Yes COVID-19 6 >40 Male No No No No Healthy 7 <30 Female Yes Yes No Yes COVID-19 8 30-40 Male Yes No Yes Yes Flu 9 >40 Female Yes Yes Yes Yes COVID-19 10 30-40 Male No Yes No No Allergies B. Based on the data given, answer the following: i) What is the probability that an individual has a COVID-19 diagnosis given that they are Male and have Fatigue and Cough? ii) Given that an individual has No Fever and No Cough, what is the probability that their diagnosis is Healthy? [CAT-2 Fall 2024-25] Q9. For the Bayesian network given below: [CAT-2 Winter 2019-20] a. Calculate the probability that the door is open, it is wife and not a burglar, also the car is in the garage, and the door is not damaged. b. Calculate the probability that it is the burglar, the door is open and also damaged and there is no car in garage. c. Calculate the probability that the door is closed, it is not wife and not a burglar, also the car is in the garage, and the door is not damaged","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
