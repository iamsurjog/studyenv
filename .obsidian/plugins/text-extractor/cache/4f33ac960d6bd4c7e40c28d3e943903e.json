Maximum Marks: 5*10 = 50 Q. No. Question (Answer all questions) Max Marks CO BL 1. a) Describe different approaches to Artificial Intelligence. List the timeline of the evolution of artificial intelligence and briefly describe each period/breakthrough. [5 M] b) Consider an artificial agent learning to play chess, where the agent learns the game's rules and optimal moves through multiple plays and feedback from critics. Which type of agent would be most suitable for a chess-playing agent? Justify your answer. Also, briefly describe the agent architecture with a suitable diagram. [5 M] 10 CO1 BL3 2. Describe the task environments and their characteristics for the following agents. i. Rental Bike/Car booking ii. Cooking Robot iii. Grocery Delivery iv. Playing Chess 10 CO1 BL4 3. Apply the following search algorithms to find a path from the node A to G in the given graph: [3 * 2 = 6 M] i) Depth First Search (DFS) ii) Depth-limited search (L=2) iii) Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) Note: Process the nodes alphabetically for the nodes at the same level. b) Analyze the above algorithms regarding completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity. [4 M] 10 CO2 BL5 4. Apply A* Search algorithm to find the shortest path from a to z using the following graph: The heuristic values for each node is given below: Node a b c d e f h(n) 21 14 18 18 5 8 10 CO2 BL5 5.
