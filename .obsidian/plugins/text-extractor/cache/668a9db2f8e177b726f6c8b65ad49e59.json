CH2023240502690 100 01. A. Outline the key functionalities of the operating system for the smart home automation platformn and describe how each functionality contributes to the seamless operation and management of smart devices in the home environment (5 Mark). Answer all questions (4 X 10 Marks = 40 Marks) B. Additionally, discuss the challenges you might encounter in implementing these functionalities and propose strategies to address these challenges while ensuring reliability, security, and user convenience. ( 5 Mark) 02. Write a C program that demonstrates how threads can be used for multimedia processing without [10] relying on mutexes for synchronization. Your program should include the following functionalities: Audio Playback Thread: Create a thread that simulates playing audio. This thread should check a global variable audio paused before playing each audio segment. If audio paused is 1, the thread should skip audio playback. Video Display Thread: Create a thread that simulates displaying video frames. This thread should continuously display video frames without any interruptions. User Input Thread: Implement a thread to handle user input. This thread should wait for user commands and respond accordingly. The user can input commands to pause/resume audio or exit the program. a) Ensure proper handling of user input and thread management in your program. Utilize Use a global variable audio _paused to control audio playback state. Explain how would you ensure the correctness and reliability of the program without implementing the concept of mutex.

(6 marks) Phones:Arrival Time(Minutes) ]Repair Time(Minutes) A B E 3 5 4 2 Create schedules for the mobile phone repair using two scheduling methods: a) One where phones are handled in the order they arrive. b. b) Another where tasks are executed in a cyclical manner with each phone receiving a fixed time slice 5 minutes. i) Display the Gantt chart and Calculate the turnaround time for both scheduling methods mentioned above.(4 marks) i) Calculate the waiting time and response time for both scheduling methods mentioned above. (4 marks) iil) Determine which scheduling method minimizes the average waiting time. (2 Marks) 04. The Barber's problem is a classic synchronization problem that involves multiple customers and a single barber. The barber has a limited number of chairs in the waiting room, and customers may enter the barber shop to get a haircut or wait in the waiting room if the barber is busy. As an expert answer the following a. How would you optimize the management of chairs in the waiting room to minimize the waiting time for customers while ensuring that the barber is not overwhelmed with too many customers at once? (5 Mark) How do you ensure that the solution is robust in a concurrent programming environment, avoiding potential issues such as deadlock while multipie threads/processes are accessing shared resources like chairs and the barber's services? (5 Mark) Process VMI VM2 VM3 05. Imagine a cloud computing environment where multiple virtual machines (VMs) are running different applications and services. Each VM requires access to various resources such as CPU cycles in MIPS (RI), main memory in MB (R2), secondary storage in GB (R3), and network bandwidth in Mbps (R4). Suggest a suitable algorithm to ensure efficient resource utilization and prevent potential deadlock situations among VMs. At time t=3ms, the maximum resources that can request by each VM, already allocated, and available are given below: VM4 VMS |10 7 3 9 4 2 2 2 R1 R2 R3 R4 3 Answer all questions (4 X 15 Marks = 60 Marks) Allocation 1 4 2 1 1 Section - II 1 R1 4 2 3 4 Maximum R2 2 3 2 R3 R4 RI 1 2 3 2 2 4 3 1 3 Available (Work) R2 2 R3 [10] [15] R4 4 Page 2 iCht uhthw the sy stem hus a ckuatlock or not Find the satety sequcnce if there is no ii V2wNts an akltinal vwounve (,0, 1, 0, willit be granted innmediately.

(10 Marks) b) Some systenns autonatically delete all user files when a user logs off or a job terminates, mless the UsCr eNplicily requests that they should be kept. Other systenms keep all files unless the user explicitly deletes them, ìscuss the relative merits of each approach. (S Marks) O8, ln a fully autonated car parking, for parking the carN, operator has to seareh and specify the shel number, where cach car is kept in the separate shell.
