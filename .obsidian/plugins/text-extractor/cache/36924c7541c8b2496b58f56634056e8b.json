[10 Marks] 1. \"MediaStream\" is a growing digital media company with a library of millions of high resolution images and videos. The company faces several critical challenges with its traditional on-premise storage solution: a. Scalability Limitations: Their storage servers are constantly running out of space, requiring frequent and expensive hardware upgrades. This manual scaling process is inefficient and cannot keep up with the exponential growth of new content. b. High Costs: Maintaining and powering on-premise storage is expensive. They also face significant costs for off-site backups to ensure data durability. c. Lack of Durability and Reliability: The risk of data loss due to hardware failure is a constant threat. A single server crash could lead to the permanent loss of valuable media assets. d. Poor Global Performance: Serving high-resolution content to a global audience from a single data center results in high latency, slow load times, and a poor user experience for customers in different geographical regions. e. Complex Management: The IT team spends significant time managing file permissions, backups, and data migration, taking away from more strategic tasks. MediaStream decides to migrate its entire media library to any one Amazon Storage Service that should have Industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Identify the correct storage service and justify with its features, pros and pricing strategy 2. CodeStream's development and data science teams faced several challenges with their traditional on-premise shared storage: a. Fixed Capacity: Their Network File System (NFS) server had a fixed storage capacity. As the teams' projects and datasets grew, they constantly had to purchase and configure new hardware, a time-consuming and expensive process. b. Performance Bottlenecks: During peak usage, multiple developers or data analysts accessing the same files would cause performance degradation and slow down their workflows. c. Single Point of Failure: The on-premise NFS server was a single point of failure. If the server went down, both teams would lose access to all their shared data, halting work and impacting project deadlines. d. Complex Management: The IT team spent a significant amount of time on maintenance, patching, backups, and managing file permissions for the shared storage server. To solve these problems, CodeStream migrated its shared file storage to Amazon Y. Y provides a simple, scalable, and elastic NFS file system that can be shared across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. Discuss the implementation steps and illustration of Y. 3. \"WebStream,\" a company that provides a content management system (CMS), needs to ensure its platform is highly available and resilient to failure. Their current architecture, which relies on a single web server and an attached storage volume in one data center, has several critical weaknesses: a. Single Point of Failure: If the single Availability Zone where their infrastructure resides experiences an outage, the entire CMS platform becomes unavailable to all customers, leading to a loss of service and revenue. b. Scalability Issues: The single server cannot handle a sudden surge in user traffic. While they can scale vertically (use a bigger server), this is a temporary and expensive solution. c. Manual Data Synchronization: To achieve a form of redundancy, they would have to manually synchronize data between servers in different locations, a complex and error-prone process. To overcome these challenges, WebStream re-architects its platform using a high-availability, multi-Availability Zone design on AWS. The core of this new architecture is an Amazon X which serves as a single, shared storage repository for all application servers. Discuss the system architecture of the above scenario by identifying X along with its working mechanism. 4. ShopNow\" is a rapidly growing online retail company. Their e-commerce website is hosted on a single server, which worked well initially. However, the company faces several critical challenges: a. Traffic Spikes: During major sales events (e.g., Black Friday, flash sales), the number of concurrent users can spike from a few hundred to tens of thousands in minutes. The single server frequently crashes under this load, causing downtime and lost sales. b. Single Point of Failure: If the server fails for any reason (hardware malfunction, software error), the entire website becomes unavailable. This poses a significant risk to the business and its reputation. c. Manual Scaling: The IT team has to manually provision and configure new servers in anticipation of major events. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient, as the extra servers sit idle during off-peak hours. d. Poor Performance: Even when not at peak capacity, the server's response time is inconsistent, leading to a poor user experience and high bounce rates. To address these issues, ShopNow decides to migrate its website to a cloud based infrastructure and implement X. Identify X and implement the solution that has following components like Multiple Web Servers, X, Auto Scaling, Health Checks with the configuration steps. 5.
