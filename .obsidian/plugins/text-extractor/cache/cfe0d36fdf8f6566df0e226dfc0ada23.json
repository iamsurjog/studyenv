A process delivers a message to UDP, which is encapsulated in a user datagram and sent over the network. UDP conserves the message boundaries; each message is independent of any other message. • This is a desirable feature when we are dealing with applications such as IP telephony and transmission of real-time data. However, UDP is unreliable; the sender cannot know the destiny of messages sent. A message can be lost, duplicated, or received out of order. UDP also lacks some other features, such as congestion control and flow control, needed for a friendly transport layer protocol. • TCP is a byte-oriented protocol. It receives a message or messages from a process stores them as a stream of bytes, and sends them in segments. There is no preservation of the message boundaries. However, TCP is a reliable protocol. • The duplicate segments are detected, the lost segments are resent, and the bytes are delivered to the end process in order. TCP also has congestion control and flow control mechanisms.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
