The speed of light propagation delay on each link is 3x10**8 m/sec. Note that the transmission rates are in Mbps and the link distances are in Km. Assume a packet length of 16000 bits. Give your answer in milliseconds. Solution: Link 1 transmission delay = L/R = 16000 bits / 10 Mbps = 1.600000 msec. Link 1 propagation delay = d/s = 2 Km / 3*10**8 m/sec = 0.006667 msec. Link 2 transmission delay = L/R = 16000 bits / 100 Mbps = 0.160000 msec. Link 2 propagation delay = d/s = 1000 Km / 3*10**8 m/sec = 3.333333 msec. Link 3 transmission delay = L/R = 16000 bits / 100 Mbps = 0.160000 msec. Link 3 propagation delay = d/s = 3 Km / 3*10**8 m/sec = 0.010000 msec. Thus, the total end-to-end delay is the sum of these six delays: 5.270000 msecs. Q.No.5 Q1. Suppose that the packet length is L= 8000 bits, and that the link transmission rate along the link to router on the right is R = 1 Mbps. . What is the transmission delay? What is the maximum number of packets per second that can be transmitted by this link? HThe transmission delay = L/R = 8000 bits / 1000000 bps = 0.008 seconds The number of packets that can be transmitted in a second into the link = R / L = 1000000 bps / 8000 bits = 125 packets Q6.A network with bandwidth of 10 Mbps can pass only an average of 12,000 frames per minute with each frame carrying an average of 10,000 bits. What is the throughput of this network? Q7.What are the propagation time and the transmission time for a 2.5-kbyte message (an e-mail) if the bandwidth of the network is 1 Gbps? Assume that the distance between the sender and the receiver is 12,000 km and that light travels at 2.4 × 108 m/s. Solution Propagation Delay = Distance/Propagation speed Transmission Delay = Message size/bandwidth bps Latency = Propagation delay + Transmission delay + Queueing time + Processing time Q8. What are the propagation time and the transmission time for a 5-Mbyte message (an image) if the bandwidth of the network is 1 Mbps? Assume that the distance between the sender and the receiver is 12,000 km and that light travels at 2.4 × 108 m/s. Solution 3.14 Suppose a signal travels through a transmission medium and its power is reduced to one-half. This means that P2 is (1/2)P1. In this case, the attenuation (loss of power) can be calculated as A loss of 3 dB (–3 dB) is equivalent to losing one-half the power. 3.15 Question:11 3.16 12. 3.18 13.The loss in a cable is usually defined in decibels per kilometer (dB/km). If the signal at the beginning of a cable with −0.3 dB/km has a power of 2 mW, what is the power of the signal at 5 km? Solution The loss in the cable in decibels is 5 × (−0.3) = −1.5 dB. We can calculate the power as 14.Consider a noiseless channel with a bandwidth of 3000 Hz transmitting a signal with two signal levels.

There are three switches between end-users (sender and receiver) on this network, with a channel capacity (bandwidth) of 10 Mbps. Calculate the total time it takes to send a 100-byte message from sender to recipient using the information below (Consider the given parameters according to the requirement). The propagation speed is estimated to be 2.4 * 10^8 m/s. The hop distance between two nodes is 12,000 kilometres. The header is 100 bytes long. The circuit setup time is 10 seconds, and the circuit disconnect time is half that of the setup time.
