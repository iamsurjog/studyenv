No: 22 BCE2?8 > KEEPING MOBILE PHONE/ELECTRONIC GADGETS, EVEN IN 'OFF POSITION IS TREATED AS EXAM MALPRACTICE DON'T WRITE ANYTHING ON THE QUESTION PAPER is going to establish a computer lab. The requirements of each lab are listed below. Your task is to suggest the topology and give justification for selecting the topology in the view of cost-effectiveness, reliability and accessibility. Also discuss the challenges present in the topology. a) In a university campus, there are three departments and each department [8] Department 1: Totally 50 computers have to be connected. Each computer is connected to two others, forming a closed loop. Data has to travel in one direction. Department 2: The lab is situated in a narrow room space, so the network setup has to be with a single central cable running along the length of the lab, with each student's workstation connected to this cable via a short cable. Department 3: This is a research project lab with high end computers and printer, the data are so precious. So, if one device fails or a cable is damaged, the rest of the network should remain unaffected, ensuring uninterrupted service for other users. The financial implications are not a primary concern in this decision-making process. b) Discuss the need for protocols and standards. a) Stored on a flash memory device is a 200 megabyte (MB) message to be transmitted by an e-mail from one server to another, passing three nodes of a connectionless network. This network forces packets to be of size 10KB, excluding a packet header of 40 bytes. Nodes are 400 miles apart, and servers are 50 miles away from their corresponding nodes. All transmission links are of type 100Mb/s. The processing time at each node is 0.2 seconds. i. Find the propagation delays per packet between a server and a node and between nodes. ii. Find the total time required to send this message. Slot: D1+TD1 Max. Marks: 100 b) Compare and contrast Circuit switching and Packet Switching.

A midsized organization is granted with 190.168.0.0/16, design a subnetting scheme that supports 8 subnets, with each subnet capable of supporting up to 400 hosts. b) What is the subnet mask? What is the range of valid host address (Usable address), network address, and broadcast address in each subnet? What is the total number of usable IP addresses in this scheme? a) llustrate the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 protocols header. b) What is NAT? What are the situations where Network Address Translations is required? a) Examine the network diagram provided. Demonstrate the process of the Distance Vector Routing algorithm to determine the minimum cost paths from Node F (located at the far right of the diagram) to all other nodes. Also explicitly list all the shortest path routes from F to all destinations that are the result of the algorithm's computation. llustrate each step of the process using diagrams. [3] a) List out the types of DNS messages. With a neat frame format enumerate DNS messages with its header. [4] b) Name the categories of HTTP header. Write short notes on each header with its descriptions. (3] [6] [4) b) How the count to infinity problem is solved in Distance Vector Routing? What [3] are limitations in this? [7] Explain the congestion control techniques used to improve QoS of the computer [10] network. [5] [5] Page 2 of 3 9a) 9.b) 10.a) suppose we want to transmit the mescage 1o11 0010 0100 1011 and protect it from errors using the CRC polynomial y® 4x² +x+ 1. i. Use polynomial long division to determine the message that should be transmitted. ii. Suppose the leftmost bit of the message is inverted due to noise on the transmission link. What is the resuit of the receiver's CRC calculation? How does the receiver know that an error has occurredr Two hosts are in a CSMA/cD network and the medium has a data transfer capacity of 1Gbps. The minimum frame length is fixed to 1,000 bits and the propagation speed is 2 x10^8 m/s. i) What will be the distance between the hosts? i) lfit is an Ethernet network, what is the efficiency when the hosts have a maximum distance between them? If the distance is reduced to 1 m, does it impact the efficiency? OR After you finish the router prototype, you need to test it with different packet switching technologies, which may have different MTU. In a test, your router has 3 links with MTU as below: Link 1 2 3 MTU(in bytes) 60 420 1000 i) The router receives a 600-byte IPv4 packet from link 3, and it needs to send it to link 2. What will happen? Which header fields need to be updated? ii) If the 600-byte IPv4 packet from link 3 has 20 bytes header, at least how many packets need to be sent over link 2? Write down the value of total length, flag and fragmentation offset fields of each outgoing packet. OR ii) The router receives 20 fragmented packets from link 1, and needs to send them to link 3. How many packets will be sent over link 3? (5] 56C/L/TX (5] [4 [6) [3] [4] [3] 10.b) Use link state routing algorithm to find the shortest path from node E to all the [10) other nodes and show the forwarding table at node E.
