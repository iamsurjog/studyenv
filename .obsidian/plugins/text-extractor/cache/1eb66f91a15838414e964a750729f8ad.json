Generate 3AC for the following code snippet and represent the following code into Quadruple, triples and indirect triples form. main( ) } int i; int a[10]; i = 1; while (i <= 701 ) Identify the basic blocks and construct a flow graph for the below prime number counting code from a large given array. Also identify loops in the flow graph. for (i=2; i<=n; i++) a[i] = TRUE; count = 0; s= sqrt(n); for (i=2; i<=s; itt) if (a[il) /* i has been found to be a prime */ count+t; for (i=2*i; j<=n; j = jti) (1) t1: 4*i a[i] = 0; i=i+ 1; Give the DAG representation of basic block for the following three address code and apply suitable peephole optimization techniques to generate optimized code.

Construct the LL (1) parse table for the newW grammar; is the new grammar is LL (1) grammar? Explain your answer carefully. OR Construct a recursive descent parser for the grammar S ’\"sY|Y. Will it parse correctly? Page 3 of 4 10.a) 10.b) The following gramnmar generates expressions formed by applying an arithmetic operator + to integer and real constants. When two integers are added, the resulting type is integer, otherwise, it is real ii. E ’E+T|T T’ num.num | num Give a syntax-directed definition to determine the type of each sub expression. Extend the syntax-directed definition of (a) to translate expressions into postfix notation as well as determining types. Use the unary operator inttoreal' to convert an integer value into an equivalent real value, so that both operands of + in the postfix form have the same type. OR Formulate SDT for syntax tree construction for a simple desk calculator and show how the expression 2+4*5^2 is evaluated. Page 4 of 4","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
