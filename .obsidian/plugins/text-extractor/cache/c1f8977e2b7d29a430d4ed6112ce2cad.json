Let the propagation delay from station A to station D be 1 hour i.e. if the data packet bit starts to move at 10 a.m., then it will reach D at 11 a.m. • At 10 a.m. both the stations, A and D sense the carrier as free and start their transmission. • If the total propagation delay is 1 hour, then after half an hour both the station’s first bits will reach halfway and will soon experience a collision. • So, exactly at 10:30 a.m., there will be a collision which will produce collision signals. • At 11 a.m. the collision signals will reach stations A and D i.e. exactly after one hour the stations receive the collision signal Case 1 • Therefore, for the respective stations to detect that it’s their own data that got collided the transmission time for both the stations should be greater than their propagation time. i.e. Tt>Tp • Where Tt is the transmission time and Tp is the propagation time Case 2 • Station A started the transmission at 10 a.m. and is about to reach station D at 10:59:59 a.m. • At this time, station D started its transmission after sensing the carrier as free. • So here the first bit of data packet sent from station D will face collision with the data packet of station A. • After collision occurred, the carrier starts sending a colloidal signal. • Station A will receive the collision signal after 1 hour. • In this is the condition for detecting collision in the worst case where if a station wants to detect collision then it should keep on transmitting the data till 2Tp, i.e. Tt>2*Tp. • Efficiency = Tt / ( C*2*Tp + Tt + Tp) • Tt -> transmission time • Tp -> propagation time C -> number of collision","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
