To help students to acquire knowledge in design, implement and analyze performance of OSI and TCP-IP based Architectures. 3. To identify the suitable application layer protocols for specific applications and its respective security mechanisms Course Outcome On completion of this course, student should be able to: 1. Interpret the different building blocks of Communication network and its architecture. 2. Contrast different types of switching networks and analyze the performance of network 3. Identify and analyze error and flow control mechanisms in data link layer. 4. Design sub-netting and analyze the performance of network layer with various routing protocols. 5. Compare various congestion control mechanisms and identify appropriate transport layer protocol for real time applications with appropriate security mechanism. Indicative Experiments 1. Study of Basic Network Commands, Demo session of all networking hardware and Functionalities 2. Error detection and correction mechanisms 3. Flow control mechanisms 4. IP addressing Classless addressing 5. Observing Packets across the network and Performance Analysis of Routing protocols 6.
