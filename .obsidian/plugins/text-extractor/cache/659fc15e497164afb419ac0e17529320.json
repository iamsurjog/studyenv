Navathe Chapter 4 Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Modeling Slide 4- 3Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Chapter Outline  EER stands for Enhanced ER or Extended ER  EER Model Concepts  Includes all modeling concepts of basic ER  Additional concepts:  subclasses/superclasses  specialization/generalization  categories (UNION types)  attribute and relationship inheritance  These are fundamental to conceptual modeling  The additional EER concepts are used to model applications more completely and more accurately  EER includes some object-oriented concepts, such as inheritance Slide 4- 4Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Subclasses and Superclasses (1)  An entity type may have additional meaningful subgroupings of its entities  Example: EMPLOYEE may be further grouped into:  SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN, …  Based on the EMPLOYEE’s Job  MANAGER  EMPLOYEEs who are managers  SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE  Based on the EMPLOYEE’s method of pay  EER diagrams extend ER diagrams to represent these additional subgroupings, called subclasses or subtypes Slide 4- 5Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Subclasses and Superclasses Slide 4- 6Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Subclasses and Superclasses (2)  Each of these subgroupings is a subset of EMPLOYEE entities  Each is called a subclass of EMPLOYEE  EMPLOYEE is the superclass for each of these subclasses  These are called superclass/subclass relationships:  EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY  EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN  EMPLOYEE/MANAGER  … Slide 4- 7Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Subclasses and Superclasses (3)  These are also called IS-A relationships  SECRETARY IS-A EMPLOYEE, TECHNICIAN IS-A EMPLOYEE, ….  Note: An entity that is member of a subclass represents the same real-world entity as some member of the superclass:  The subclass member is the same entity in a distinct specific role  An entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it must also be a member of the superclass  A member of the superclass can be optionally included as a member of any number of its subclasses Slide 4- 8Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Subclasses and Superclasses (4)  Examples:  A salaried employee who is also an engineer belongs to the two subclasses:  ENGINEER, and  SALARIED_EMPLOYEE  A salaried employee who is also an engineering manager belongs to the three subclasses:  MANAGER,  ENGINEER, and  SALARIED_EMPLOYEE  It is not necessary that every entity in a superclass be a member of some subclass Slide 4- 9Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Representing Specialization in EER Diagrams Slide 4- 10Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Attribute Inheritance in Superclass / Subclass Relationships  An entity that is member of a subclass inherits  All attributes of the entity as a member of the superclass  All relationships of the entity as a member of the superclass  Example:  In the previous slide, SECRETARY (as well as TECHNICIAN and ENGINEER) inherit the attributes Name, SSN, …, from EMPLOYEE  Every SECRETARY entity will have values for the inherited attributes Slide 4- 11Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization (1)  Specialization is the process of defining a set of subclasses of a superclass  The set of subclasses is based upon some distinguishing characteristics of the entities in the superclass  Example: {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} is a specialization of EMPLOYEE based upon job type.  May have several specializations of the same superclass Slide 4- 12Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization (2)  Example: Another specialization of EMPLOYEE based on method of pay is {SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE}.  Superclass/subclass relationships and specialization can be diagrammatically represented in EER diagrams  Attributes of a subclass are called specific or local attributes.  For example, the attribute TypingSpeed of SECRETARY  The subclass can also participate in specific relationship types.  For example, a relationship BELONGS_TO of HOURLY_EMPLOYEE Slide 4- 13Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization (3) Slide 4- 14Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Generalization  Generalization is the reverse of the specialization process  Several classes with common features are generalized into a superclass;  original classes become its subclasses  Example: CAR, TRUCK generalized into VEHICLE;  both CAR, TRUCK become subclasses of the superclass VEHICLE.  We can view {CAR, TRUCK} as a specialization of VEHICLE  Alternatively, we can view VEHICLE as a generalization of CAR and TRUCK Slide 4- 15Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Generalization (2) Slide 4- 16Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Generalization and Specialization (1)  Diagrammatic notation are sometimes used to distinguish between generalization and specialization  Arrow pointing to the generalized superclass represents a generalization  Arrows pointing to the specialized subclasses represent a specialization  We do not use this notation because it is often subjective as to which process is more appropriate for a particular situation  We advocate not drawing any arrows Slide 4- 17Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Generalization and Specialization (2)  Data Modeling with Specialization and Generalization  A superclass or subclass represents a collection (or set or grouping) of entities  It also represents a particular type of entity  Shown in rectangles in EER diagrams (as are entity types)  We can call all entity types (and their corresponding collections) classes, whether they are entity types, superclasses, or subclasses Slide 4- 18Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (1)  If we can determine exactly those entities that will become members of each subclass by a condition, the subclasses are called predicate- defined (or condition-defined) subclasses  Condition is a constraint that determines subclass members  Display a predicate-defined subclass by writing the predicate condition next to the line attaching the subclass to its superclass Slide 4- 19Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (2)  If all subclasses in a specialization have membership condition on same attribute of the superclass, specialization is called an attribute-defined specialization  Attribute is called the defining attribute of the specialization  Example: JobType is the defining attribute of the specialization {SECRETARY, TECHNICIAN, ENGINEER} of EMPLOYEE  If no condition determines membership, the subclass is called user-defined  Membership in a subclass is determined by the database users by applying an operation to add an entity to the subclass  Membership in the subclass is specified individually for each entity in the superclass by the user Slide 4- 20Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Displaying an attribute-defined specialization in EER diagrams Slide 4- 21Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (3)  Two basic constraints can apply to a specialization/generalization:  Disjointness Constraint:  Completeness Constraint: Slide 4- 22Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (4)  Disjointness Constraint:  Specifies that the subclasses of the specialization must be disjoint:  an entity can be a member of at most one of the subclasses of the specialization  Specified by d in EER diagram  If not disjoint, specialization is overlapping:  that is the same entity may be a member of more than one subclass of the specialization  Specified by o in EER diagram Slide 4- 23Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (5)  Completeness Constraint:  Total specifies that every entity in the superclass must be a member of some subclass in the specialization/generalization  Shown in EER diagrams by a double line  Partial allows an entity not to belong to any of the subclasses  Shown in EER diagrams by a single line Slide 4- 24Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (6)  Hence, we have four types of specialization/generalization:  Disjoint, total  Disjoint, partial  Overlapping, total  Overlapping, partial  Note: Generalization usually is total because the superclass is derived from the subclasses. Slide 4- 25Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Example of disjoint partial Specialization Slide 4- 26Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Example of overlapping total Specialization Slide 4- 27Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (1)  A subclass may itself have further subclasses specified on it  forms a hierarchy or a lattice  Hierarchy has a constraint that every subclass has only one superclass (called single inheritance); this is basically a tree structure  In a lattice, a subclass can be subclass of more than one superclass (called multiple inheritance) Slide 4- 28Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Shared Subclass “Engineering_Manager” Slide 4- 29Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (2)  In a lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits attributes not only of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses  A subclass with more than one superclass is called a shared subclass (multiple inheritance)  Can have:  specialization hierarchies or lattices, or  generalization hierarchies or lattices,  depending on how they were derived  We just use specialization (to stand for the end result of either specialization or generalization) Slide 4- 30Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (3)  In specialization, start with an entity type and then define subclasses of the entity type by successive specialization  called a top down conceptual refinement process  In generalization, start with many entity types and generalize those that have common properties  Called a bottom up conceptual synthesis process  In practice, a combination of both processes is usually employed Slide 4- 31Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Specialization / Generalization Lattice Example (UNIVERSITY) Slide 4- 32Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Categories (UNION TYPES) (1)  All of the superclass/subclass relationships we have seen thus far have a single superclass  A shared subclass is a subclass in:  more than one distinct superclass/subclass relationships  each relationships has a single superclass  shared subclass leads to multiple inheritance  In some cases, we need to model a single superclass/subclass relationship with more than one superclass  Superclasses can represent different entity types  Such a subclass is called a category or UNION TYPE Slide 4- 33Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Categories (UNION TYPES) (2)  Example: In a database for vehicle registration, a vehicle owner can be a PERSON, a BANK (holding a lien on a vehicle) or a COMPANY.  A category (UNION type) called OWNER is created to represent a subset of the union of the three superclasses COMPANY, BANK, and PERSON  A category member must exist in at least one of its superclasses  Difference from shared subclass, which is a:  subset of the intersection of its superclasses  shared subclass member must exist in all of its superclasses Slide 4- 34Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Two categories (UNION types): OWNER, REGISTERED_VEHICLE Slide 4- 35Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Formal Definitions of EER Model (1)  Class C:  A type of entity with a corresponding set of entities:  could be entity type, subclass, superclass, or category  Note: The definition of relationship type in ER/EER should have 'entity type' replaced with 'class‘ to allow relationships among classes in general  Subclass S is a class whose:  Type inherits all the attributes and relationship of a class C  Set of entities must always be a subset of the set of entities of the other class C  S ⊆ C  C is called the superclass of S  A superclass/subclass relationship exists between S and C Slide 4- 36Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Formal Definitions of EER Model (2)  Specialization Z: Z = {S1, S2,…, Sn} is a set of subclasses with same superclass G; hence, G/Si is a superclass relationship for i = 1, …., n.  G is called a generalization of the subclasses {S1, S2,…, Sn}  Z is total if we always have:  S1 ∪ S2 ∪ … ∪ Sn = G;  Otherwise, Z is partial.  Z is disjoint if we always have:  Si ∩ S2 empty-set for i ≠ j;  Otherwise, Z is overlapping. Slide 4- 37Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Formal Definitions of EER Model (3)  Subclass S of C is predicate defined if predicate (condition) p on attributes of C is used to specify membership in S;  that is, S = C[p], where C[p] is the set of entities in C that satisfy condition p  A subclass not defined by a predicate is called user- defined  Attribute-defined specialization: if a predicate A = ci (where A is an attribute of G and ci is a constant value from the domain of A) is used to specify membership in each subclass Si in Z  Note: If ci ≠ cj for i ≠ j, and A is single-valued, then the attribute-defined specialization will be disjoint. Slide 4- 38Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Formal Definitions of EER Model (4)  Category or UNION type T  A class that is a subset of the union of n defining superclasses D1, D2,…Dn, n>1:  T ⊆ (D1 ∪ D2 ∪ … ∪ Dn)  Can have a predicate pi on the attributes of Di to specify entities of Di that are members of T.  If a predicate is specified on every Di: T = (D1[p1] ∪ D2[p2] ∪…∪ Dn[pn]) Slide 4- 39Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Alternative diagrammatic notations  ER/EER diagrams are a specific notation for displaying the concepts of the model diagrammatically  DB design tools use many alternative notations for the same or similar concepts  One popular alternative notation uses UML class diagrams  see next slides for UML class diagrams and other alternative notations Slide 4- 40Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe UML Example for Displaying Specialization / Generalization Slide 4- 41Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Alternative Diagrammatic Notations Slide 4- 42Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe General Conceptual Modeling Concepts  GENERAL DATA ABSTRACTIONS  CLASSIFICATION and INSTANTIATION  AGGREGATION and ASSOCIATION (relationships)  GENERALIZATION and SPECIALIZATION  IDENTIFICATION  CONSTRAINTS  CARDINALITY (Min and Max)  COVERAGE (Total vs. Partial, and Exclusive (disjoint) vs. Overlapping) Slide 4- 43Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe Ontologies  Use conceptual modeling and other tools to develop “a specification of a conceptualization”  Specification refers to the language and vocabulary (data model concepts) used  Conceptualization refers to the description (schema) of the concepts of a particular field of knowledge and the relationships among these concepts  Many medical, scientific, and engineering ontologies are being developed as a means of standardizing concepts and terminology Slide 4- 44Copyright © 2007 Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B.
