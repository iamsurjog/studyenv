Put simply, AWS compute is the means to provision and manage infrastructure(virtual machines/containers) for your use case. AWS provides many flexible computing services so as to meet the requirements of business organizations like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, AWS Lambda and many more. This infrastructure as a service can be considered as the processing power required by your applications, to host applications or run computation-intensive tasks. Introduction to AWS Compute In AWS, with the use of these computing services, users can dynamically provision the number of resources they are using and then pay only for the computing resources they have used for. This leads to the reduction of the upfront capital investment required. These compute resources are closely related to regular server components like CPU and RAM. However, for regular server components, you need to manage and buy the infrastructure, provide for backups and emergency recovery, and ensure enough server capacity to handle traffic-intensive times. With AWS compute all this headache is handed over to the AWS team. Amazon EC2 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers and system administrators the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios Launching an Amazon EC2 instance [nine key decisions to make when you create an EC2 instance by using the AWS Management Console Launch Instance Wizard] Select an AMI Instance types Specify Network SettingsAttach IAM role (optional) User data script (optional) Example Specify storage Add tags Security group settings • When you define a rule, you can specify the allowable source of the network communication (inbound rules) or destination (outbound rules). •The source can be an IP address, an IP address range, another security group, a gateway VPC endpoint, or anywhere (which means that all sources will be allowed). •By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. • You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that only allow specific outbound traffic. • If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic that originates from your instance is allowed Identify or create the key pair","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
