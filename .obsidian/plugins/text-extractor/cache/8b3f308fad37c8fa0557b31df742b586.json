OSI Model OSI LayersIntroduction  Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model (OSI Reference Model or OSI Model) is an abstract description for layered communications and computer network protocol design.  It was developed as part of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative. In its most basic form, it divides network architecture into seven layers which, from top to bottom, are the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data- Link, and Physical Layers.  It is therefore often referred to as the OSI Seven Layer Model. 6 APPLICATION APPLICATION PRESENTATION PRESENTATION SESSION SESSION TRANSPORT TRANSPORT NETWORK NETWORK DATA LINK DATA LINK PHYSICAL PHYSICAL APPLICATION APPLICATION PRESENTATION PRESENTATION SESSION SESSION TRANSPORT TRANSPORT NETWORK NETWORK DATA LINK DATA LINK PHYSICAL PHYSICAL MIDDLE LAYER MIDDLE LAYER HIGHER LAY ER HIGHER LAY ER Application to Application Application to Application Application to Application Process to Process LOWER LAYER LOWER LAYER Hop to Hop Switch Hop to Hop Physical Medium Hub and Repeater Router Source to Destination Source to Destination OSI Model's 7 LayersOSI Model's 7 Layers 7 Host and Media LayerHost and Media Layer 8 These terms are used to refer at which OSI layer we are referring to, the data remain same but the headers and trailers are getting added or removed. In Phy layer i.e. physical layer the actual data is in \"bits\" i.e. 0 and 1. When it reaches to data link layer or Layer 2 it becomes \"frame\" with source and destination mac address getting added. When it reaches the third layer or the networking layer it becomes a \"packet\" with source and destination IP address attached to it. Finally it become \"segment\" at Layer 4 or TCP/IP layer. Basically \"segment\" term is used for TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connections and \"datagrams\" for UDP(User Datagram Protocol). So what about other layers like : session, presentation and application ? In these layers the data is termed as \"PDU\" or \"protocol data unit\". So when someone says, that a \"frame\" is being received by a networking device, then you know that the device is switch. 9 DataH7 USER (Human or Program) To presentation layer DataH7 Application layer Application layer Message Message Application Layer (user level service)  The application layer is responsible for providing services to the user.  Concerned:  Network virtual terminal (Software)  File transfer, access and management  Mail services  Directory services (access to distributed database sources for global information about various objects and services) X.500 FTAM X.400 X.500 FTAM X.400 From presentation layer USER (Human or Program) 10 Presentation Layer (dependency)  The presentation layer is responsible for translation, compression and encryption(syntax or format, semantics  Concerned:  Translation (interoperability between different encoding system)  Encryption (Privacy schemes)  Compression (data compression) DataH6 From application layer To session layer DataH6 To application layer From session layer presentation layer presentation layer  Encryption and decryption of a message for security  Compression and expansion of a message so that it travels efficiently  Graphics formatting  Content translation  System-specific translation 1112 Session Layer (Dialog initiation)  The session layer is responsible for dialog control and synchronization  Concerned:  Dialog Control (Half Duplex/Full duplex)  Synchronization (Synchronization points, process inline within same page) DataH5 From Presentation layer To transport layer Data Data Syn Syn Syn DataH5 To Presentation layer From transport layer Data Data Syn Syn Syn Session layer Session layer Transport Layer (Process to Process)  The transport layer is responsible for the delivery of a message from one process to another  Concerned:  Service-point addressing (Port address)  Segmentation and reassembly (Sequence number)  Connection control (Connectionless or connection oriented)  Flow control (end to end)  Error Control (Process to Process) Segments Segments DataH4 From session layer To network layer Transport layer DataH4 DataH4 SegmentsSegments DataH4 From session layer From network layer Transport layer DataH4 DataH4  • Application identification  • Client-side entity identification  • Confirmation that the entire message arrived intact  • Segmentation of data for network transport  • Control of data flow to prevent memory overruns  • Establishment and maintenance of both ends of virtual circuits  • Transmission-error detection  • Realignment of segmented data in the correct order on the receiving side  • Multiplexing or sharing of multiple sessions over a single physical link 1415 Network Layer (Source to Destination)  The network layer is responsible for the delivery of individual packets from the source host to the destination host.  Concerned:  Logical addressing (IP Address)  Routing (Source to destination transmission between networks) DataH3 Packet From transport layer To data link layer DataH3 Packet To transport layer From data link layer Network layer Network layer  Virtual connection between application entities  Synchronization of data flow  Creation of dialog units  Connection parameter negotiations  Partitioning of services into functional groups  Acknowledgements of data received during a session  Retransmission of data if it is not received by a device 1617 Data Link Layer (Host to Host)  Data link layer is responsible for moving frames from one hop (Node) to the next.  Concerned:  Framing (stream of bits into manageable data units)  Physical addressing (MAC Address)  Flow Control (mechanism for overwhelming the receiver)  Error Control (trailer, retransmission)  Access Control (defining master device in the same link) DataH2 T2 From network layer DataH2 T2 To network layer To physical layer From physical layer Data link layer Data link layer  Layer 2 of the OSI model provides the following functions:  Allows a device to access the network to send and receive messages  Offers a physical address so a device’s data can be sent on the network  Works with a device’s networking software when sending and receiving messages  Provides error-detection capability  Common networking components that function at layer 2 include:  • Network interface cards  • Ethernet and Token Ring switches  • Bridges 18 Physical Layer  One of the major function of the physical layer is to move data in the form of electromagnetic signals across a transmission medium.  Its responsible for movements of individual bits from one hop (Node) to next.  Both data and the signals can be either analog or digital.  Transmission media work by conducting energy along a physical path which can be wired or wireless  Concerned:  Physical characteristics of interface and medium (Transmission medium)  Representation of bits (stream of bits (0s or 1s) with no interpretation and encoded into signals)  Data rate (duration of a bit, which is how long it last)  Synchronization of bits (sender and receivers clock must be synchronized)  Line configuration (Point-to-Point, Point-to-Multipoint)  Physical topology  Transmission mode (Simplex, half duplex, full duplex) 10101000000010111110 From data link layer 10101000000010111 110 To data link layer

network, transport, and application. The first four layers link, network, transport, and application. The first four layers provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model. The three topmost layers in the OSI model, of the OSI model. The three topmost layers in the OSI model, however, are represented in TCP/IP by a single layer called the however, are represented in TCP/IP by a single layer called the application layer.application layer.
