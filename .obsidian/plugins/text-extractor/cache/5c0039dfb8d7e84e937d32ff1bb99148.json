Permission required for reproduction or display.2 1-1 DATA COMMUNICATIONS The term telecommunication means communication at a distance. The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data. Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. Components Data Representation Data Flow Topics discussed in this section: 3 Figure 1.1 Five components of data communication 4 Figure 1.2 Data flow (simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex) 5 1-2 NETWORKS A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network. Distributed Processing Network Criteria Physical Structures Network Models Categories of Networks Interconnection of Networks: Internetwork Topics discussed in this section: 6 Figure 1.3 Types of connections: point-to-point and multipoint 7 Figure 1.4 Categories of topology 8 Figure 1.5 A fully connected mesh topology (five devices) (n*(n-1)/2)=10 9 Figure 1.6 A star topology connecting four stations n 10 Figure 1.7 A bus topology connecting three stations 11 Figure 1.8 A ring topology connecting six stations 12 Figure 1.9 A hybrid topology: a star backbone with three bus networks 13 Network Models • Computer networks are created by different entities. • Standards are needed so that these heterogeneous networks can communicate with one another. • The two best-known standards are the OSI model and the Internet model.  LAN  MAN  WAN 14 Categories of Networks 15 Figure 1.10 An isolated LAN connecting 12 computers to a hub in a closet 16 Figure 1.11 WANs: a switched WAN and a point-to-point WAN 17 Internetwork- Interconnection of network • When two or more networks are connected, they become an internetwork, or internet. • Assume that an organization has two offices, one on the east coast and the other on the west coast. The established office on the west coast has a bus topology LAN; • The newly opened office on the east coast has a star topology LAN. • The president of the company lives somewhere in the middle and needs to have control over the company. 18 Figure 1.12 A heterogeneous network made of four WANs and two LANs 19 1-3 THE INTERNET The Internet has revolutionized many aspects of our daily lives. It has affected the way we do business as well as the way we spend our leisure time. The Internet is a communication system that has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips and organized it for our use. A Brief History The Internet Today (ISPs) Topics discussed in this section: A Brief History  In the mid-1960s, mainframe computers in research organizations were standalone devices.  In 1967, at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) meeting, ARPA presented its ideas for ARPANET, a small network of connected computers.  By 1969, ARPANET was a reality. Four nodes, were connected via the IMPs to form a network. Software called the Network Control Protocol (NCP) provided communication between the hosts.  In 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core ARPANET group, collaborated on what they called the Internetting Project  Cerf and Kahn's landmark 1973 paper outlined the protocols to achieve end-to-end delivery of packets. This paper on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) included concepts such as encapsulation, the datagram, and the functions of a gateway. 2021 Figure 1.13 Hierarchical organization of the Internet 22 1-4 PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS In this section, we define two widely used terms: protocols and standards. First, we define protocol, which is synonymous with rule. Then we discuss standards, which are agreed-upon rules. Protocols Standards Standards Organizations Internet Standards Topics discussed in this section: Protocol  A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications.  Syntax. The term syntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the order in which they are presented  Semantics. The word semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits.  Timing. The term timing refers to two characteristics: when data should be sent and how fast they can be sent. 23 Standards  Data communication standards fall into two categories: de facto (meaning \"by fact\" or \"by convention\") and de jure (meaning \"by law\" or \"by regulation\").  De facto- standards are often established originally by manufacturers who seek to define the functionality of a new product or technology.  De jure. Those standards that have been legislated by an officially recognized body are de jure standards. 24 Standards Organization  International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  International Telecommunication  American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  Electronic Industries Association (EIA). Regulatory Agencies  All communications technology is subject to regulation by government agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. 25","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
