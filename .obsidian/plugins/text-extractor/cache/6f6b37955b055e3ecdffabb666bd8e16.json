Types of AI: • Narrow AI (ANI): Performs specific tasks (e.g., Chess AI). • General AI (AGI): Human-level intelligence across many tasks (hypothetical). • Super AI (ASI): Exceeds human intelligence (speculative). 7/14/2025 Computer Science 6 AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans. It enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognition.

AI technology can be helpful for understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc. ▪ To take on the challenges, astronomers are turning to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to build new tools to rapidly search for the next big breakthroughs. AI in Healthcare ▪ In the last, five to ten years, AI becoming more advantageous for the healthcare industry and going to have a significant impact on this industry. ▪ Healthcare Industries are applying AI to make a better and faster diagnosis than humans. AI can help doctors with diagnoses and can inform when patients are worsening so that medical help can reach to the patient before hospitalization. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 15 AI applications cont… AI in Gaming ▪ AI can be used for gaming purpose. The AI machines can play strategic games like chess, where the machine needs to think of a large number of possible places. AI in Finance ▪ AI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing automation, Chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial processes. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 16 AI applications cont… AI in Data Security ▪ The security of data is crucial for every company and cyber-attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital world. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as AEG bot, AI2 Platform are used to determine software bug and cyber-attacks in a better way. AI in Social Media ▪ Social Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat contain billions of user profiles, which need to be stored and managed in a very efficient way. AI can organize and manage massive amounts of data. AI can analyze lots of data to identify the latest trends, hashtag, and requirement of different users. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 17 AI applications cont… AI in Entertainment ▪ We are currently using some AI based applications in our daily life with some entertainment services such as Netflix or Amazon. With the help of ML/AI algorithms, these services show the recommendations for programs or shows. AI in Travel & Transport ▪ AI is becoming highly demanding for travel industries. AI is capable of doing various travel related works such as from making travel arrangement to suggesting the hotels, flights, and best routes to the customers. Travel industries are using AI- powered chatbots which can make human-like interaction with customers for better and fast response. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 18 AI applications cont… AI in education ▪ AI can automate grading so that the tutor can have more time to teach. AI Chatbot can communicate with students as a teaching assistant. ▪ AI in the future can be work as a personal virtual tutor for students, which will be accessible easily at any time and any place. AI in E-commerce ▪ AI is providing a competitive edge to the e- commerce industry, and it is becoming more demanding in the e-commerce business. AI is helping shoppers to discover associated products with recommended size, color, or even brand. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 19 AI applications cont… AI in Robotics: ▪ Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre- programmed. ▪ Humanoid Robots are best examples for AI in robotics, recently the intelligent Humanoid robot named as Erica and Sophia has been developed which can talk and behave like humans. 7/14/2025 Computer Science 20 Thank you 7/14/2025 Dr. Durgesh Kumar, AI (BCSE306L) 21 Questions ?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
