Diferentiate packet switching from circuit switching. For voice traffic which switching technique is more suitable, discuss with respect to QoS. CH2022232500375 03. A network using Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) has a bandwidth of 10Mbps. If the maximum propagation time (including the delay in the devices and ignoring the time needed to send a jamming signal) is 25.6us, what is the minimum size of the (iüi) Show the shortest form of the following IPv6 address -> 2340:0000:0000:0000:0000:119A:A001:0000 (1 Mark) 04. (i) Change the following IPv4 addresses from binary notation to dotted-decimal notation -> 01111111 11110000 01100111 01111101 (I Mark) (ii) Change the following IPv4 addresses from dotted-decimal notation to binary notation -> 129.14.6.8 (1 Mark) Part -B (7X 10 Marks) Answer All questions (iv) Show the original (unabbreviated) form of the following IPv6 address 0:1234:3 (2 Marks) 05. Compare and Contrast the Distance Vector and Link State Routing Approach. 06. Suppose a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection is transferring a file of 5000 bytes. The first byte is numbered 10,001. What are the sequence numbers for each segment if data are sent in five segments, each carrying 1000 bytes. 07. If you would like to take up a job profile as eithera network architect or design engincer or support engineer or network admin or tester, you are required to provide services and solutions at any layer. Justify that you are cligible to take up that role by elaborating on the functionalities and services provided by ISO standardized OSl model, with neat illustration. 08. Consider 6 hops (point-to-point links) between two terminal nodes; Transmission rate 9600 bps on all links; Ims per-hop signal propagation delay. I second for call set-up time for circuit switched connection across 6 hops; message size 10000 bits; each packet size 2048 bits (2000 bits for message and 48 bits for overhead [lHeader + Trailer]). Find total time delay for both the circuit and packet switching networks. 09. Using the Selective Repeat protocol, draw a flow diagram of a sender with a window size 4 and has six data frames to send. Label all the data frames with the Sequence Numbers (SNs) and returning ACKs with the corresponding numbers. (5] (5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [10] [10] [10) Page 1 of 3 (i)) Assume io frarne is lost during transmission. Show how the window slides over as acknowlcdgeienis come in and new frames are transmitted, when operated under Selective Repeat protocol. (ii) Redo the problem i) showing what happens when the 2nd data frame transmission (SN=1) is lost. 1G. You are a network engineer of an organization that has 3 business units (or departments): (10] Engineering, Finance and Administration. You need to buy a block of IP Addresses in order to provide Internet connectivity to the organization's network. Each business unit forms a separate subnet. The Engineering unit needs 120 IP Addresses, the Finance units needs 60 addresses and the Administration unit needs 30 addresses. The 3 subnets are connected via an access router as shown in Fig. 1. The ISP assigned your network a classless block \"128.64.0.0/24\". (iyfind the total number and range of addresses allotted to your organization. (2 Marks) (ii) Find the range of address allotted for each of your business unit along with it's subnet prefix/mask. (6 Marks) Gii) Analyze the unallocated address left after your allocation to the business units. (2 Marks) From ISP Network Fig. 1 15.0.0.2 15.0.0.1 R2 11. Interpret Fig. 2 comprising of several networks interconnected by routers. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is enabled in these routers. What will be the initial table of R1 and after enabling RIP, Compute the routing table of Router R1 and illustrate the process carried out by RIP. 14.0.0.2 15.0.0.0 140.0.1 Fig. 2 R6 Po Router P2 R1 16.0.0.1 R5 13.0.0.2 R3 12.0.0.3 16.0.0.0 Engineering Subnet Finance Subnet 13.000 Administration Subnet 16.0.0.2 13.0.0.3 12.000 13.0.0.1 12.0.0.2 16.0.0.3 3 13.0.0.4 12.0.0.1 R7 R 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.0 2 10.0.0.1 11.0.0.0 11.0.0.2 R R8 R4 [10] 12. Explain with necessary diagrams how Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses the congestion [10) control to alleviate congestion in the network. Also, interpret the Fig.3 graph of congestion window size (x-axis) as a function of transmission round (y-axis).

(a) Illustrate the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transaction between the client and server [10] and illustrate for the following cases (6 marks) SThe client wants to retrieve a document from the server. Use the appropriate method. i) The client wants to send data to the server. Use the appropriate method. (b) Which transport layer service does HTTP use? Differentiate various connection modes of operation used by HTTP. (4 marks) Page","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
