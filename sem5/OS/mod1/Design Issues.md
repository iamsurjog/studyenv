# Efficiency
An OS allows the computer system resources to be efficiently used.
- Most I/O devices slow the computer compared to main memory (and the CPU)
- Use Multiprogramming allows for some processes to be waiting on the I/O while another process executes
- Often I/O cannot keep up with CPU speed
- Diversity of I/O devices
- Different access methods 
Challenges:
- Minimize overhead
- Maximise throughput 
- Reduce latency
# Robustness
Ability to work even when things go wrong
Methods to test robustness:
- Fuzz testing 
- Fault injection
Distributed System
- failure of a link
- failure of a site
- loss of a message
# Flexibility
Easy updatability and changability.
- Using modular design
# Portability
Ability to run properly in a different platform
# Security
OS security plays a vital role in protecting the system, its resources, and user information from hackers malware and other threats
# Compatibility
Capacity for two systems to work without having to be altered
