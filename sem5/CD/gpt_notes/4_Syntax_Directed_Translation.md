# 🧠 4. Syntax-Directed Translation

## 📌 Concept

Combines parsing with evaluation by attaching semantic rules to grammar productions.

## 📦 Attribute Grammar

- **Synthesized Attributes**: Derived from child nodes (bottom-up)
    
- **Inherited Attributes**: Passed from parent or siblings (top-down)
    

## 🧮 Evaluation Strategies

- Post-order traversal for S-attributed grammars
    
- Semantic stack during parsing for translation schemes
    

## ⚙️ Applications

- Type Checking
    
- Symbol Table Updates
    
- Intermediate Code Generation
    

## 📝 Class Insight

> Implemented type-checking for expressions. Highlighted how inherited attributes allow passing type context for nested arrays.
